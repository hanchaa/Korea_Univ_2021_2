subject : update on prc process
today was the final ena prc . relative ranking results up through the senior
director level are final . you and your management team can begin the process
of giving performance reviews to your employees . i spoke with sheila walton
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting
the employee reviews . she indicated that the target completion date should
be the end of july .
promotions will be effective august lst . it is dave delainey ' s intent to
announce ena promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on july 24 .
this drives the end of july target completion date for reviews . i do not
yet know if delainey wants all ena promotions to be announced in a single
memo , or if each group within ena will prepare such a memo . i will keep you
updated on this as i get direction from him .
please note the following change since our energy operations prc in june . in
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid - year review
process , we will not share performance clusters with employees when
conducting their reviews . it is very important for all of us to be
consistent in this process , so please communicate this to all in your groups
who will be giving performance reviews . it is important to note , however ,
that the content of an employee ' s review should be consistent with our view
of that employee ' s relative ranking . in other words , an employee in the
satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that
the employee is doing a great job . clearly , a large number of employees
performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory
category , so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in
the organization , help you achieve the groups goals , etc .
also please note the following :
performance reviews for anyone in the satisfactory , needs improvement or
issues categories must be reviewed by hr prior to these reviews being given
to the employees . this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with
the relative performance of that employee . ( this has been the stated process
for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process
as well . )
please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team ,
yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced
members of your management team , or those management team members where you
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and
perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time
in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow
through on this commitment .
thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a
meaningful one .
it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0"

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s

brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the

we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an

big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and
notified mips . however , he was told this was not a priority item . in the
mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes .
this particular meter was correct last night , the 14 th rolled last night from

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .
please give me a call if you have any questions ."

in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of

operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the "" bar is being raised "" by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .

attached to the gulf energy 27 - 009 - 08 agreement . this gas began flowing on
7 / 7 / 00 , so deal ticket 380710 , which begins 9 / 1 / 00 will need to be backed up
to july to account for the purchase of this production .

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

notice that there is a new button at the top of the stack manager , which will
open a window showing a summary of the best price limit order bids and offers
against your managed products . you can click the "" + "" sign to the left of a
summary to show a list of all the price limit orders which have been placed
against that product .
under normal circumstances , the price shown on the website will be the same
as the price on your stack manager . however , the system will not allow you to
show a price which is better than an existing price limit order . instead , the
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing price
limit order while it is being filled . once the appropriate price limit orders
are filled , then the website will again show your stack manager prices .
it is important that you complete the  & maximum volume  8 field in the product
properties window and that you select "" allow price limit orders "" . also , make
sure that the price tick window in the stack manager  , s  & product properties  8
field is appropriate for the product . if you do not do this , your customers
will not be able to use price limit orders for your products .

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

daren ,
when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?
thanks ,

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in 1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas , they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have been connected with the lord ? s work in croatia for all these years . before leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday . dragica and i believe god listens and hears prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

fred :
i have run this issue by clem cernosek for further research , and expect to
have his answer this afternoon . in the meantime , it is my understanding that
this well is behind the big cowboy system . at this time , we have deal ticket
380710 , purchase from ccgm , l . p . on hplc / hplc . this deal should probably be
on gulf energy / bigcowboy . the producer , as i understand it , is acock
production , however , i may be mis - informed . any insight which any of you can
shed on this deal would be very welcome , i would like to capture this
accurately and definitively as early on as possible , so as to prevent any
future issues .
thank you all for your patience and assistance ,

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .

would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

shawna ,
attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and

wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might
involve your desks via eol in the near future . we already have one in the
east . i stressed to the sitara / eol folks the importance of adding comments
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is
happening . one side of these buy / sell or exchange deals will be ratable and
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality . comments will
include the corresponding deal number , that it is in fact a buy / sell or
exchange deal and the delivery time period ( 3 , 5 or 10 days ) that the
counterparty desires .
i hope this helps . . . thanks !

got any ideas on how this transaction should look . this looks like a monthly
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once
the counterparty has made their decision ( i would imagine logistics will be
the one communicating with the counterparty ) . we probably need eol to
indicate whether it is a 3 , 5 , 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this
as comments .
linda / karen - what are your thoughts on how separate gtc would work on this .
if we could all do a little homework . i will get something scheduled for
next week to discuss further .

subject : flexible physical us nat gas products on enrononline
we are positioning ourselves to release a new product type that we will refer
to as a flexible physical gas product . legal is in the process of drafting a
gtc and product type description that will be used with this product type . i
will start the building process once legal provides the gtc and product type
description ; but in the interim , here ' s a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works :
party a and party b exchange gas during the month of june 2000 .
party a buys 10 , 000 mmbtu per day ( or 300 , 000 total mmbtu ) at tco pool index
party b has the right to notify party a of when party b wants to take
delivery during the month of june , and may take delivery in one of three
forms : 3 - day delivery , 5 - day delivery , or 10 - day delivery . the gas nominated
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . ; if
party b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the
300 , 000 mmbtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100 % ) . party b pay
tco pool index plus a premium .
i understand that this type of transaction is currently done
over - the - counter . scott mills has previously issued an explanatory e - mail of
sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues .
bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a sigma factor in advance , then
my turn around time to for the product type should be reduced . also , due to
the varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will
require three different product types ?
please feel free to call if you have any questions .

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .

i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve .
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas
after all ."

texas a & m football practice was delayed on monday for nearly two hours at kyle field . one of the players , while on his way to the locker room happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking , unknown white powdery substance on the practice field .
head coach r . c . slocum immediately suspended practice while the fbi was called in to investigate . after a complete field analysis , the fbi determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line .
practice was resumed when fbi special agents decided that the team would not be likely to encounter the substance again ."

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

homeland defense report
identifying defense and security stocks ready to explode
look at the moves made by our last 2 hot picks .
mrkl . 45 to 1 . 32 in 2 days , up 193 %
ugho . 54 to 3 . 53 in 2 days , up 553 %
grab this hot defense stock and cash in on a big stock dividend .
homeland security technology , inc . otc - hstj
immediate buy - huge news plus a 30 % stock dividend
current price . 013
target price for sept . 30 . 085
first it was gold , then oil , now homeland security is the explosive
sector turning savvy stock players into millionaires . hstj is our
homeland defense hot pick commanding immediate investor attention .
hstj is an extremely undervalued player in the hottest market sector
while simultaneously declaring a stock dividend of 30 % . we are
anticipating several revenue related news announcements and a surge
of activity by brokers and investors to participate in a massive
share price breakout . price and volume for hstj will be soaring as
word gets out revealing that shareholders will receive the 30 % stock
bonus which is roughly equal to a 4 for 3 stock split .
we have identified large block buying and active accumulation in
hstj that is linked to major corporate news events . hstj supplies
military combat gear for the us armed forces and was formed for this
purpose by highly decorated military leaders . not surprisingly , hstj
has experienced a strong increase in monthly orders . keep watch for
an expanded product line as hinted by the company in recent press in
conjunction with additional orders .
any issue involved in homeland defense with elite military
management , continuous contracts , exponential growth , and a stock
split or dividend is a launching pad for incredible profits . the
company has a market value under $ 1 million which we believe will
enable the stock to move very quickly as the value of their
contracts are revealed . we expect the 30 % stock dividend to create
an added frenzy by investors loading up before hstj goes through the
roof .

subject : unresolved issues for jan 1 . - followup
here is a followup to the memo sent on 12 / 31 / 99 . fyi
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know . unresolved - appears to be unassigned ?
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . unresolved
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . unresolved
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january . resolved but needs to be verified .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated . unresolved or unpathed ?
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? unresolved
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
i haven ' t had time to do this yet . if we haven ' t figured out the assignement
then i will get to it asap ."

profited nicely . the company tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior
oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset
drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have "" the largest untapped
potential for natural gas in north america . "" new prices and technologies have
exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over
90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil
and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south
of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in
economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease
values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from
several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total
output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset
wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas
@ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6
months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again !
using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to
tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most
prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! !
withabalanced portfolioofoilgas

cdyv is the leading advertising , printing , and publishing
company in texas specializing in the very high - profit
sector of community - based weekly publications . as master
publisher for the state of texas , cdyv reaches 22 million
people , 254 counties , and over 3 , 100 towns and cities
with their tidbits publication featuring local
advertising in dozens of areas including entertainment ,
real estate / housing , consumer goods and services , and
major retailers like walgreens and dollar general .
cdyv has been in business 4 years and has grown quickly ,
now it is time for them to explode in the public markets .
cdyv is new to the stock market , having gone public in a
very quiet manner . so you have a very brief period to
get in at or near the bottom before share prices soar on
increased investor awareness . there are very few companies
that have perfected this niche of advertising platform
with none being publicly offered starting out at less than
50 cents per share .
monthly circulation has jumped from 500 , 000 to 3 million
with the additional expansion into dallas / ft . worth ,
translating into over 9 million readers monthly and
achieving an additional 17 million in annual revenues
from the metroplex area alone . cdyv will also provide the

publishers in their respective states resulting in another

represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as
their pe is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings
figures . the industry average pe is 20 , indicating that a

earlier this week , enron global technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non - standard internet email address formats . as mentioned in the previous communication , this was the first of several communications to be sent by the enron global technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our email environment .
we are working toward a cut - off date of january 14 , 2002 , at which time we will no longer support email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname . lastname @ enron . com ( or firstname . middleinitial . lastname @ enron . com if your name in lotus notes or outlook has a middle initial in it ) . we understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard email address format , but it is important to begin making the change now .
if you have questions , please send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .
thank you for your support .

subject : supported internet email addresses
enron global technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non - standard internet email address formats . the only internet email address format that will be supported , once this effort is completed , is firstname . lastname @ enron . com . we will no longer support internet email address formats such as name @ enron . com , name @ ect . enron . com , name @ ei . enron . com ( where "" name "" is an abbreviation , acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and / or lastname ) . every enron employee has an internet email address of firstname . lastname @ enron . com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this internet address format if they are not using it already .
any new / existing application systems or business cards that reference a non - supported internet email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet address format . it is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending internet email to any non - supported internet email addresses .
to determine what your supported internet email address is , take your name as it appears in outlook or lotus notes and replace any "" spaces "" that appear in your name with periods and append @ enron . com . for example in outlook , alan smith , robert ( firstname = robert , lastname = alan smith ) will have a supported internet email address of robert . alan . smith @ enron . com .
important : if you need to update your business card ( s ) to reflect your supported internet email address , please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards . if you experience any issues with delivery of internet email to your supported internet email address , please contact the resolution center .
we will communicate further details , including the cut - off date , in the coming weeks . meanwhile , it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet email address format . if you have questions regarding this email , send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .
thank you for participation , cooperation and support .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
let me know is you can ' t .

thanks , bob . it now turns out that due to operational issues , the additional 10 , 000 / d may not come on next week . spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas . i ' ll keep you posted .

it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

we need to forward the money from the feb 2001 brazos sale to tenaska iv . i am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $ 1 , 143 , 484 . 53 . there is already a demand fee for feb 2001 for $ 29 , 851 . 64 , so i think we just need to change that to the new amount . let me know if you want to handle this differently .

deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january 20 . the
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
turnaround .
it is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown .
please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer .

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet ."

t after she took that shot & didn ' t . but she was high before she took it & i guess she didn ' t think about it getting low . i don ' t know what will happen to her when she leaves home .
but anyway , i wanted to let you know that we ' re going to dallas to look for the prom dress & shoes , don ' t know if we will stay all night or not . i haven ' t talked to shane & shelley . i wanted to stay & go to saturn rd . to church & go to the singles class . but i don ' t know what shane & shelley have planned . so we ' ll be back either sat . night or sun . lacy has to be back to work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once . so , wish us luck . any donations will be appreciated ! i hear they ' re more than i was expecting . but anyway , i don ' t intend to go overboard . maybe there will be some sales .

madonna enrolls at prestigious university
pop queen madonna is so frustrated she sacrificed her education for pop music - she ' s allegedly enrolled at britain ' s prestigious oxford university for a degree in english literature . the material girl rekindled her love of books after writing popular children ' s series the english roses , and is looking forward to studying for a bachelor of arts qualification from home , with the celebrated institution which counts four british kings , 47 nobel prize - winners , 25 british prime ministers and six saints as past students . an insider tells britain ' s the sun newspaper , madonna was always irritated about giving up her schooling when her career took off . she is fiercely intelligent and incredibly well read and has always taken a keen interest in literature . she is determined to get a qualification . she sets herself new challenges all the time and the oxford university course is her latest . it ' s an illustrious place to study and she was delighted to be accepted and will make the most of the opportunity .

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

subject : path manager rewrite / optimization project
importance : high
all :
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .
the sooner we get someone to devote to this , the better off we will be . i expect these changes that we ' ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit .
that being said , we ' ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager .
1 ) currently , the path manager attempts to reuse path ids . i can ' t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step ? it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .
2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard ."

my contact at beaumont methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the
following : to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling
for beaumont methanol at meter # 1428 .
first some background : we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station
that we own and control , but which also feeds brandywine / dupont . in fact ,
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station
before it gets to beamont methanol . sometimes we are doing business with
both beaumont methanol and brandywine / dupont . . . . . but sometime we only do
business with one of them .
whom to call for any nominations and scheduling issues for beaumont methanol :
bob dorcheus - brandywine / dupont - 281 - 293 - 1789
chyral hankins - beaumont methanol ( terra ) - 712 - 233 - 6558
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with
regard to scheduling and nomination issues . they are out of the loop on
these issues . if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues , it will cause confusion of
the type we had yesterday and today .
obviously , it is of course ok for hpl gas control to call the beaumont
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues .

the quality of included studies was poor overall we did not detect bias
induced by any of the measures assessed we could not obtain data on all
cause fatality for 33 % of studies it is unlikely that missing results would
shift the results for studies comparing the same lactam relative risk 1 02
0 76 to 1 38 but it is of concern that studies comparing different lactams
0 85 0 69 to 1 05 may not detect important harm to patients
our assessment of treatment effects for patients with p aeruginosa gram
negative and blood infections relies on subgroup analysis we did not detect
an advantage for combination therapy among these patients only few patients
with documented p aeruginosa infections could be evaluated

please take the necessary steps to classify this meter as ' inactive ' and
insure that no future volumes flow through this meter .
charlie - we will leave this station in place for now and try to recapture
this market in three years . please have this station locked and secured as
soon as possible to prevent lubrizol from taking any unauthorized volumes

car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .

transfer the sum of us $ 16 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( sixteen million , five hundred thousand united
states dollars ) into your private / company account . the fund came about as a result of a
contract awarded and executed on behalf of my ministry the federal ministry of works
and housing . the contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to
the tune of us $ 60 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( sixty million united states dollars ) . but in the course
of negotiation , the contract was awarded to a bulgarian contractor at the cost of
us $ 43 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( forty - three million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ) to
my benefit unknown to the contractor .
this contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the bulgarian firm is
presently securing payment from my ministry , where i am the executive director in -
charge of all foreign contract payment approval . as a civil servant still in active
government service , i am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of
nigeria . hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present
your private / company account details as a beneficiary
of contractual claims alongside that of the bulgarian contractor , to enable me
transfer the difference of us $ 16 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( sixteen million , five hundred thousand
united states dollars ) into your providedaccount .
on actualisation , the fund will be disbursed as stated below :
1 . 20 % of the fund will be for you as beneficiary
2 . 10 % for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be
incurred during the course of the transaction .
3 . 70 % of the fund will be for me which i intend to invest in real estate business

worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working
days of commencement . you can reach me through this e - mail address

this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to
reiterate retro contract assignments . we have decided to go back to the old
process of handling contract assignments mid - month . this means that if we
receive an assignment from legal after the 10 th workday , that assignment will
become effective for current month the following month . for example , if i
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on 11 / 15 / 00
for an legal effective date of 4 / 00 , i will create a new deal from 4 / 00
forward . on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the
expected volumes . bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12 / 00 ,
leaving 4 / 00 - 11 / 00 to be moved by volume mangement .
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties , please let me know .
rita : if this becomes burdensome on your group , please let me know and we
will readdress this issue .
thanks ! !

511,1,"Subject: reply soon ! ! !
dear sir ,
i know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using the
only secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business .
it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and
assistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i am
dr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former
military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )
who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as
i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,
hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .
i have lost confidence with anybody within the country .
having noted the confidence reposed on your person ,
i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving
the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general
( my husband ) .
this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have
all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for
safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to
avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .
it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my
organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this
organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .
on your acceptance to render this assistance to me
to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a
conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for
non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian
administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the
federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family
because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late
husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have
resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including
properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the
various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,
the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of
seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our
family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .
in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our
family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has
called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the
demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very
soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas
amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come
to my full assistance and unlimited
co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole
family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living
on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the
sins
of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy
and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my
children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will
compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of
the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .
in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your
discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in
your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur
( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by
you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my
children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with
the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe
operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance
company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide
owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through
dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and
phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .
i look forward to your quick response while thanking
you for your co - operation . in view of all above
details , i request you to keep this letter and
co - operation highly confidential .
best wishes ,
mrs . mariam abacha .

i spoke to mr . maldinado this morning and it doesn ' t look good . he claims he

short term or long term ? again , anything you want , but probably long term is
better .
i pointed out that there isn ' t an energy minister in saudi and would he know
the name of the minister whose giving him the gas ? he stumbled and couldn ' t

520,0,"Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 .
i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only ."
521,0,"Subject: sale of hpl
to all :
the proposed sale of hpl to american electric power ( aep ) has been signed and
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming
months . over the next few days , i will be forwarding more details about the
transition process . these details will outline the employment opportunities
and transfer process to aep . aep is eager to complete these arrangements ,
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it .
during the transition period , it is important that we keep the pipe line
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy
needs of our customers .

yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

steve ,
two questions :
1 ) . does the answer below suffice for our needs ?
and
2 ) . if yes , and with pat ' s answer in mind , would this be a cost that would
go to your group first , then to ed as o & m , or would it go directly to ed ?
i am not sure who has the ability to control these cost more directly , you or
ed ?
thanks ,
troy

in reviewing the spread the minimal volumes being reported are associated
with the gas that supplies instrumentation on the pipeline , i . e . pressure and

for prior periods - i am not sure if you need to handle this using the
instructions below - or if for prior months only - if you would be allowed
to create a
cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances . your controller
and volume management ( kathy kelly ) should make this call .
kim and david can brain check me on this - but i think this is how parking
should be done ; however ,
please verify with west or east desk economics to ensure accuracy / consistency .
parking procedures
create a storage deal in sitara - service type : parking
use this service deal to path to a storage account in unify - this way you
have accounted for the gas in unify
inject into storage account
withdrawal from storage account
( when you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a
"" loan "" )
create two economic deals in sitara - exchange deal
create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position
purposes - ( no invoices - fake 3 rd party )
exchange deal -
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas )
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back )
within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees
which can be recorded on the storage deal .
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
when the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the
short term you record a big loss - sell at $ 0 - and the
next month you record a big gain - buy at $ 0 . to manage this - usually the
cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick
up the time
spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value .
when you are adjusting your physical injections ( parking ) within the month -
you will need to
adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the p & l for the time spread
accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems .
period 1 - sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0 swap
to firm book for index + mid
period 2 - buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
swap to firm book for index + mid"

with respect to ( 1 ) , if ena can ' t effectively manage the plant ' s positions , who can you recommend that could under the same terms ? as you recall , the equity owners do have a buyer interested in the asset , so the arrangement would probably be short - term at best .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .

593,0,"Subject: spinaker / n . padre island block 883 : allocations
per our various discussions , i am sending an email to reiterate the
disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this
time , the general land office is transporting their share of production
( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % .
the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september
1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl
purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had
both deals moved to 9862 . the meter should probably be designated a
callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after
the production month by volume management .
for october production forward , i am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter
to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their
percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any
large balance swings on their agreement .
anita : for september , i need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket
379424 ; hpl gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . please unallocate the transport
and purchase at 9848 . the meter is a daily swing right now . let me know
when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology .
i apologize for the length of this email , i want to make sure that we are all
on the same page , to the extent that we need to be , prior to this deal
getting too far down the road . please do not hesitate to call me if you have
any questions , comments , concerns , etc . i am at extension 35251 .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in

i joined brian redmond on his visit a few weeks ago to sid richardson . during that visit sr indicated that they have firm lone star transport that they want to sell ( only details i know at this time is that it is 45 mm / d point to point on a true firm basis ) . i believe we could use this transport to back stop the falcon transaction ( parking gas in their facility oct / nov 01 - jan 04 ) . i spoke with the folks at sr today and indicated that we want to know more details about the sale to see if we could garner interest internally . they gave me the name of a person in their shop who would be right person to talk to about the details . i understand you would be the right person to a ) . bounce this idea off of and b ) . if there is an interest on this transport i presume you would be the best person to get the details on this transport from sr .
the name of the person to talk to at sr is scott walker ( 817 . 810 . 9385 ) .
i ' d like to touch base with about this .
thanks

just wanted to keep everyone on point in terms of the importance and
expectations of getting this king ranch issue cleaned up for the prior months
and correct on a go forward basis . i spoke with brenda on friday to give her
an update of our progress and one of the things that she stressed and wanted
passed on to the team was the expectations that king ranch would be clean
( scheduled and allocated correctly ) for march and foward . as of thursday
night ' s p & l calc . , unaccounted for march 2000 on texas was a little over
400 , 000 mmbtus . as you all know , that number is way too high and should be a
lot lower ( on a bad month , no more than 100 , 000 mmbuts ) . hopefully , if king
ranch is the part of the problem for march and we get these issues resolved ,
march will not be an issue . i appreciate everyone ' s committment so far and
hopefully we can apply this team concept in the future to prevent crisis
modes like this from here on out . if anyone has questions or concerns ,
please do not hesitate to let me know . thanks !

if the plant is down , brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it
if brazos does not call for the gas , then we will sell off to whomever we can
we just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu , whether it goes to the plant or
not

it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business
opportunity ."

i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig
ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i
forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of
contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper
scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we
be kept in the loop , especially on retroactive deals , as scheduling ,
transport rates and risk are affected .

i just wanted to write and thank you for spur - m .
i suffered from poor sperm count and motility . i found
your site and ordered spur - m fertility blend for men .
i have wondered for years what caused low semen and sperm
count , and how i could improve my fertility and help my wife
conceive . spur - m seems to have done just that ! thank you
for your support .
andrew h . , london , uk
spur - m really does help improve fertility and effectiveness
of sperm and semen motility . i used it for the past few months ,
and not only does it work - i also feel better to . i have
more energy . this is an excellent counter to low sperm count
and motility . i ' ll be buying more ! ! !
franz k . , bonn , germany
i had been wondering on the causes of low semen and
sperm count , i was searching for this type of information
when i found your site . i hadn ' t been made aware of this
product before then , so was quite surprised to be able
to find a male fertility product . usually everything is
geared towards female fertility . suffice to say i ordered
and a few months later we received the good news from the
doctors - my wife is pregnant . i can ' t be 100 % sure if
it was spur - m that helped . but i am happy enough to be able
to say it should be considered by any man looking to increase
his fertility . it worked for me . thanks .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was

715,0,"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state ."

now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search
yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review
of the two systems .
i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,
both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via
an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca
adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and
sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .
the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in
sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel
quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more
channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .
after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have
said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and
are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its
oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm
has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored
comedy ) , and a few more "" experimental "" music channels which most will find
totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular
( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s
no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you
buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .
the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are
the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the
corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying
in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up
loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .
this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my
cancelling xm .
xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent
music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept
xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no
matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered
everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the
talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the
useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .
xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius
also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .
however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all
have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for
the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where
the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows ."

please endeavour to use this for charity .
calvary greetings ! !
my name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a
nationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with
kuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile
crash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .
before his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive
we protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life
insurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance
company . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the
purpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of
accrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund
and the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but
unfortunately he dies .
recently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer
problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this
sickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the
breaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved
in an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december
1999 .
having known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate
this fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a
christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to
instruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches ,
orphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to
ensure that the house of god is maintained .
i took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit
this money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are
not christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by
unbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in
an ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .
i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is
entitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord .
exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my
peace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so .
with god all things are possible .
i have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive
your reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the
contacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the
freezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process
the liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you
to take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a
reality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i
pray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project .
i want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i
lived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord
must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through
your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other
people for this same purpose .
please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in
anyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always
remember me in your prayers . expecting to hearing from you .
remain blessed in the name of the lord .
yours in christ ,
mrs . ruth makary .

megan ,
the april and may nomination spreadsheets from producer services reflect that there were purchases from conoco on hpl . there are no references to any purchases from conoco on gepl . on june 6 , 2001 , tom acton edited deal ticket # 133304 to include gepl meter # ' s 27 - 002 - 08 and 27 - 003 - 08 . i have no idea why tom edited the deal ticket to include the gepl meters . tom is no longer at aep and i couldn ' t find any documentation to support the changes . please advise if you need additional information .

pat ,
i have been working with volume management , settlements , vance , and bob to
clean up some prior period and prior - to - current month issues . this process
should result in a correction to booked profit / loss for vance and the desk .
this has brought to my attention that we have been paying some parties
manually for volumes when deals are not correctly entered . i would propose
that logistics be included in the communication of when checks are manually
cut . it would be especially beneficial if we tracked manual checks by
counterparty , meter , and / or deal ticket id or price . i feel that this will
allow us to spot and resolve potential issues more effectively .
please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter .
thank you for your time ,

756,0,"Subject: big cowboy - additional production
tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at "" hpl meters "" at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .
please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or information to add .

subject : bridgeline workorder
i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you
updated on the progress .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
thanks ,

hey guys ,
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that
howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the
meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk -
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below
e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what
we all want between our groups , but i want to ensure that everyone does their
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you
both think . thanks !

this one appears tame , smith said ,
but could be dangerous because wild animals are unpredictable . people should not
approach it , nor should they run away from the animal since that could provoke a
chase . the best thing to do is ignore it , keep away from it and call the
authorities , he g to tales circulating the wooded neighborhood off , the animal
walked up to a man as he was swinging his toddler in the back yard . the cat is
said to have lunged at the child . as the story goes , the man fended it off with
a chair , his wife grabbed their child , and they ran into the house . the cat sat
on their back deck for a while looking in , just like at the in another tale on a
different street , a teenage baby sitter was at the backyard pool with an
8 - year - old boy and his cousin . the cat sneaked up on them from behind , and she
jumped into the pool with the boy . they swam to the other side , but it followed
them . they all ran into the house , and the cat sat looking in the door .

darren :
i am working with jim pond to clean up the ua 4 that has been booked to cleburne since the beginning of the deal . we are starting with november 2000 . gas accounting has booked 21 , 309 mmbtu as ua 4 for november , which is related to deal 502861 on the texas desk . it looks like we took some of the gas we purchased from williams ( deal 384237 ) on the cleburne desk and moved it to ena ' s transport contract with deal 502861 . the print screen below shows the deal from zone transport to ena - texas . i think we need a deal from cleburne to zone transport to complete to deal path and clean up the ua 4 . can you review the deals for november and let me know what you think ? jim says there is ua 4 every month of this deal and this may be the reason . i will have to check each month .
thanks ,

subject : re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

lauri , from a legal standpoint , we can cut the nomination on an
interruptible agreement at our discretion . the contract clearly gives us
this right . i haven ' t specifically reviewed the contract , but i am assuming
it is our standard form . i will check this .
yes , i would consider hisd facilities to be state facilities . the fact that
this goes to entex first complicates the issue .
dan , was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities , or if
it ultimately ended up at state facilities ?

gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?
thanks for your help ."

deal # 466305 , but this deal expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 .
currently , logistic has september and october 2000 volumes recorded to hpl
strangers gas contract . in order to correct this , hpl logistics needs either
( 1 ) deals # 133196 or # 466305 extended to cover september and october 2000 ,
( 2 ) a new deal to cover september and october 2000 , or ( 3 ) logistics needs
approval to write - off these volumes to unaccounted for gas loss . ( print ,
sign , and return the original to clem cernosek ) .
deal / deal ticket # / customer ( buyer / seller )
or
approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
in addition , since deal # 466305 expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 and gas is still
flowing , logistics needs either ( 1 ) deal # 466305 extended , or ( 2 ) a new deal
to cover december 2000 and any other future months that this production is
flowing into hpl ' s pipeline .

brian ,
i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .
thanks

a lot has happened since we last met - but i wanted to get back to you
on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on
the topic and have asked our engineers ( dave owen and tom hodge ) to get
in touch with brad to look at the physical interconnection options . we
are doing the same with tw and it would be good to understand more about
your system and your objectives . i would also like to understand your
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not )
like to work with enron on this .
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like i can forward one for your review .

team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .
regards ,
brian"

look thru the sequence history . the meter # on the opposite side did not change
even though the pipe code did . that is all i have to suggest .

i need to get the approval from daren farmer ext . 3 - 6905 . please feel
free to contact him to discuss this matter .
also , i do not believe the meter no . will be the same . i searched pi
grid and it shows hpl with drn 92686 interconnect with meter no .
237 - 07 - 1 - 004 , drn 26879 for teco pipeline co .
we have discrepencies / isssues .
what verifying information do you have for this meter ?

red - neck valentine ' s love poem
collards is green
my dog ' s name is blue
and i ' m so lucky
to have a sweet thang like you .
yore hair is like cornsilk
a - flapping in the breeze
softer than old blue ' s
and without all them fleas .
you move like the bass ,
which excite me in may .
you ain ' t got no scales
but i luv you anyway .
yo ' re as satisfy ' n as okry
jist a - fry ' n in the pan .
yo ' re as fragrant as "" snuff ""
right out of the can .
you have som ' a yore teeth ,
for which i am proud ;
i hold my head high
when we ' re in a crowd .
on special occasions ,
when you shave under yore arms ,
well , i ' m in hawg heaven ,
and awed by yore charms .
still them fellers at work ,
they all want to know ,
what i did to deserve
such a purdy , young doe .
like a good roll of duct tape
yo ' re there fer yore man ,
to patch up life ' s troubles
and fix what you can .
yo ' re as cute as a junebug
a - buzzin ' overhead .
you ain ' t mean like those far ants
i found in my bed .
cut from the best cloth
like a plaid flannel shirt ,
you spark up my life
more than a fresh load of dirt .
when you hold me real tight
like a padded gunrack ,
my life is complete ;
ain ' t nuttin ' i lack .
yore complexion , it ' s perfection ,
like the best vinyl sidin ' .
despite all the years ,
yore age , it keeps hidin ' .
me ' n ' you ' s we go together
just like a moon pie
with a rc cold drank ,
yep , we go together
like a skunk goes with stank .
some men , they buy chocolate
for valentine ' s day ;
they git it at wal - mart ,
it ' s romantic that way .
some men git roses
on that special day
from the cooler at kroger .
"" that ' s impressive , "" i say .
some men buy fine diamonds
from a flea market booth .
"" diamonds are forever , ""
they explain , suave and couth .
but for this man , honey ,
these won ' t do .
cause yo ' re too special ,
you sweet thang you .
i got you a gift ,
without taste nor odor ,
more useful than diamonds . . .
it ' s a new trollin ' motor ! !

hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

assignment )
changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to
assignment )
fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .
thanks ,

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

several changes have been made to stack manager and the website . these changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of monday september 3 , 2001 .
stack manager changes
activate / inactivate stack - this functionality allows the trader to pull a product ' s prices from the website without suspending the product . if the top of stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product ; therefore , if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website .
if a product ' s stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager . if the stack is active it will appear in black font .
to use this feature , select the product , right click and choose "" inactivate stack "" . when you are ready to reactivate your prices , select the same product , right click again and choose "" activate stack "" . there are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will activate / inactivate the stack of the highlighted product . see screen shot below for the icons .
changes to product properties - currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen , the product will be suspended and pulled from the website . now instead of being suspended , the product ' s stack will become inactive . once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the activate stack icon as discussed above .
website change
restrictions on top of stack orders - if top of stack limit orders are allowed on a product , but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer , limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product .
if you have any questions please call me at 31787 . thanks .

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

red bank , n . j . , aug 24 , 2004 ( primezone
via comtex ) - - the following is a letter from john
figliolini , president of atlantis business development
corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf
dear shareholder , addlrko
i am writing to you today to
discuss the new direction which your company will be
heading . up until this point we made it clear that
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
the market . our basic premise was to seek out
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
businesses with the proper equity investment made into
them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;
with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
various projects they are currently working on .
e - direct is another example ; we should start to see
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has
not maintained a particular industry focus . as of
today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
last week we announced that abdv
will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to
future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,
a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start
of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in
locating and provide managerial , accounting and
financing for companies in the energy field , from oil
and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
you may ask ; why the energy
related field ? simply it currently offers many
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
to be made in this sector . according to adjusted
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis
of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem
to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand
for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this
year alone , most of which is because of china . the
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30
level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented
in stone . there are more players in the world economy
today that require oil gas to propel their own
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself
with individuals that have experience in the energy
field . these individuals will help locate viable
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira
so what do we do with our
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
until they are at a level where they can move on their
own . i believe that both of these companies will be
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at
that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the
basic premise of our business module whereby we share
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
public our portfolio companies . we can then continue
to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw
by concentrating on a specific
sector such as the energy area we will be able to
define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our
goal will be to locate and make investments in no less
than four energy - related businesses over the next 12
months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an
investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative
way to participate in the booming oil gas and
energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm

it is with sadness and regret that we announce that cliff baxter is resigning as an employee of enron . we are happy , though , that cliff ' s primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family .
cliff is a unique talent . his creativity , intelligence , sense of humor , and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career . he will be missed .
cliff joined enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built enron ' s wholesale business . before becoming vice chairman of enron , cliff served in a variety of positions in enron ' s wholesale businesses , culminating in his appointment as chairman and chief executive officer of enron north america in 1999 .
we have asked cliff , and he has agreed , to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions .

breaking news : posted jan 9 , 2 : 28 pm
dynegy not opposed to enron auction ; senate subcommittee to issue 51 subpoenas
nearly 20 of bankrupt enron corp . ' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations .
the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company .
under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets .
among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , "" absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries . "" kansas city , mo - based aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used . aquila wants the auction ' s proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of enron receive the money .
however , dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction , said company spokesman steve stengel , who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it . "" dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of enron ' s trading business , "" he told ngi . stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of northern natural gas co . from enron to dynegy is still set to close by the end of january .
still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the subpoenas will be served on enron , its accounting firm andersen and 49 individual officers , employees and members of the board of directors . the subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , the department of labor and the department of justice .
"" the subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members , the role of the auditors , and the role of special - purpose entities , "" a subcommittee spokesman told reuters . these are some of the same types of things being investigated by the house of representatives financial services committee , the senate commerce committee and the house and senate energy committees . the spokesman said the subpoenas would allow enron and the others "" several weeks "" to respond ."

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , a
reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers ,
global oil corporation that mr . baker passed away .
on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will
or a testament , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i also discovered that mr . baker did not declare any kin or
relations in any of his official documents , including his deposit paperwork
in my possession . this has been fixed under our management . no one will ever
come forward to claim it .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the beneficiary to this investment . i am writing to you because i
cannot operate a foreign account . i want to present you as the beneficiary
of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney .
please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney
prepares the necessary documents , which will put you in place as the

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

subject : entex transistion
the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
"" account "" team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .

the new sitara to unify bridge monitor is in production .
the monitor shows deals in error state ( failed ) or in queue to bridge
( pending ) - for deals going to unify from sitara .
you will find it under - start - programs - trading - sitara - su bridge
monitor .
you may need to load the borland bde v 5 . 0 software to use this , if not
already loaded .
we enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool .
if deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
unify .
if the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group .
you can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit .
the date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal .
start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal .
sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id .
indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal .
if you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
( awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal ) . if you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks .
you can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar .
we did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons :
- the expense to build the filter .
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing .
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it .
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
state - once petro can / suncor / sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column .
- if you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel .

on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a

confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3

attn ; dear sir / madam .
i am mr . michael fisher , in charge of bills and foreign exchange remittance department of barclay ' s bank .
i am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co - operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department . we discovered an unclaimed sum of  24 . 5 million ( twenty - four million five hundred thousand british pounds sterling ) in an account belonging to one of our customer , who died in a car crash with the entire family in year 2001 .
since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money . unfortunately , neither the family nor the relation has appeared to claim this money . we cannot release this money unless somebody applies as the next of kin or relation to the deceased .
our banking guidelines indicated that if such money remained unclaimed for a period of four ( 4 ) years , it would be transferred into barclay ' s bank treasury as unclaimed fund . another officer and i in the department now decided to transfer this money into your account as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for easy collection since nobody is coming for it and we don ' t want this money to go back into the bank treasury as the unclaimed debt . in fact it is my friend that advised me to urgently arrange to transfer out this money through another foreign beneficiary outside the country .
we have decided to give you 20 % of the total sum . so please , as a matter of urgency send to me your telephone and fax numbers for effective communication . i will do my best to see that we conclude this transaction successfully on time .
please if you are interested send me an immediate mail so that i can explain the details to you , so you could understand everything about this business waiting for your urgent response .
thank you .

meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation . any imbalance between enron and duke
on the duke system receipts would be transparent to txu and worked out between
enron and duke . any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual

1066,0,"Subject: re : gas nom ' s
we ' ve talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach :
remind brazos that under exhibit 7 . 12 , page 2 of the ppa , brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant ' s mdq ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request .
the partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first , gas for resale second . if brazos ' electric nominations by hour would , given ambient conditions , cause us to use at or above the plant ' s mdq under its contracts with apache / williams ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) , gas nominations will be zero . this needs to be handled between the operators . i ' ve emphasized "" at or above "" on purpose ; if an all electric nomination would cause brazos to burn in excess of 45 , 000 dth per day , we will honor that request ( we ' re looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past , as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss ) .
after being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment , brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires ( provided they ' re still capped at 45 , 000 dth / d if they take gas ) . whenever they go this route , however , we need to hold them to the electric nomination ( i . e . , they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount ) . remind brazos that under the ppa , they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they ' ve elected to take gas .
if the issue of precedent comes up , remind them that we ' re operating in a new territory and that electric - gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months ; it wasn ' t until recently that we ' ve been able to attribute imbalance penalties to brazos , which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely .
as a show of good faith , we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed / nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations .
hope this helps to clarify where we are .

chuck ,
i just wanted to make sure everyone has the same undertstanding of the gas
nominations and usage issue . today with this most recent daily nomination
revision from brazos , brazos ( waco ) now understands that we are going to hold
them to 45 , 000 mbtu ' s when they are requesting electrical generation and gas
energy . however , i want everone of us to understand that a nomination from
brazos for a 6312 mwh , s ( 263 / hr ) , will require the plant to utilize 47 , 500 to
48 , 500 mbtu ' s at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy .
to allow brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to
be something less than 258 mw loading per hour .

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

1078,0,"Subject: new tax law update
whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes .
many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years .
but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start
planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include :
lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 .
and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the
next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals .
education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as :
? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to
$ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses .
? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 ,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits .
? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses .
? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses ,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college .
previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600
in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and
thereafter .
higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include :
? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these
types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 .
after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments .
? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t
include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older .
and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them .
as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be
flexible enough to react to year - by - year changes .
such planning is where american express financial advisors excels . i ' m
backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation , investments , estate
and retirement planning , and more to help you make the most of your
finances .
let me know if you have any questions . i look forward to seeing you .

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey , the central desk
scheduler responsible for the cilco account . the biggest variance is in
january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .

1096,0,"Subject: organizational changes
we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes
are intended to accomplish four key objectives :
first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful
business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .
this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built
around a relatively small strategic asset position .
second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting
relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to
directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units
has become increasingly difficult .
third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding
asset positions .
and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .
enron wholesale services
today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate
our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale
businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and
coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to
higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of
opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of
enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and
markets .
enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european
( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets
operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit
as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant
businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this
new structure as described below .
mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume
the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,
currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office
of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .
providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership
positions :
rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president
and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility
for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north
america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo
will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will
report to the ews office of the chairman .
sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the
middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our
broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region
will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of
the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for
enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business
into enron global assets in the near future .
diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined
ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will
focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to
the ebs office of the chairman .
jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees
to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order
to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to
facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for
at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south
america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to
the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the
transition , jim will join ees .
in addition to these changes in our international asset operations
activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale
businesses and the commercial support functions :
enron net works
louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and
ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .
enron americas
concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for
operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,
marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report
into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility
for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south
america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief
operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron
americas .
enron europe
the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia
and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john
sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .
enron global markets
enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and
ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have
responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the
exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and
associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to
enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the
commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,
equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .
enron industrial markets
enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,
president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .
commercial support for ews
the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,
the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in
the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .
to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across
ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these
newly defined roles are as follows :
mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office
operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,
with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice
president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated
services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these
services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible
for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .
legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .
regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a
regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in
the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all
european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue
to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions
and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief
of staff .
public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional
basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,
enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue
in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler
will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as
well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .
these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship
to mark palmer , vice president of communications .
business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover
ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .
attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale
services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .
enron global exploration and production
and enron wind
as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments
around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to
egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff
baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron
wind , will report to cliff .
corporate staff
we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,
government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in
that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and
community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and
chief of staff .
committee structure
in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s
growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our
business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to
be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and
the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be
drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses .
the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list .
we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee .
this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel
management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy
committee membership is also shown on the attached list .
we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to
our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles ."

hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .
resultingly , the only viable option for resolution is option 2 . we should
take the deal to zero by "" unwinding "" it .

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

bad news . . . . . the cleburne imbalance is out of control . you might want to start some payback to lonestar . lonestar ' s estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of may was 140 . 0 due them , now i guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of may shows 214 . 0 due them . i am waiting to hear back from lisa with lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy . through the 16 th , her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240 . 0 due them . . . . the plant continues to overpull , our nom to the plant which is not all 45 . 0 due to brazos ' take .
let me know what you want to do .

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,
michael"

1179,0,"Subject: new enrononline functionality
in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below .
stack manager changes
top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected .
please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .
restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as restricted top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "" restricted top of stack "" feature .
advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" all "" option from the drop down box .
website changes
new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .
the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .
price of limit orders
modify limit orders
customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the "" today ' s orders "" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the "" set "" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .
expiration time for limit orders
customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .
float the today ' s orders section
you can now float the "" limit order "" section . in order to do so , right click in the "" today ' s orders "" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window "" stay on top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .
mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .
in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .
changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users .
please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords .
if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 - 853 - 1787 .

aimee :
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the
reason for the error is that the deal , # 97929 has expired . please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it ?
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on .

the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow

fyi -
it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -
04 / 02 / 00 , were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase .
therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .
thank you all for your patience and assistance . i appreciate it !

sitara 147092 is tiered pricing . if you want , you can nom whatever volume is
on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly . it will keep
things in balance a bit better , but you can go either way . for feb there is a
base deal for 5000 / day and a term deal for 20 , 000 / day . only 15 , 000 of the
20000 is pathed ."

we did take into account the price adjustments you made . the actual purchase
cashout for 8 / 00 was $ 118 , 103 . 67 . your pricing took care of most of the
cashout , but there was still a balance . the over delivery pricing per mmbtu
in the contract is the difference between hsc spot - 0 . 05 and hsc index , so
gd - 0 . 10 didn ' t quite cover the entire cashout . i have attached the calc
sheet in case you need it .

yet received third party transport rates , so if you know of any , please let

your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them . rule of thumb
was that if i had to add a month , i refreshed the rate but left volume at
zero . if the months were already on the ticket , then i refreshed the rate
and left the volume as is .
i would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
they ' re reflected in position manager correctly . please let me know if you
have any questions . all pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning .

we have a buyback under hpl ( # 586534 ) . ena had only 7 , 000 / day scheduled at
mtr 1373 in feb . in reviewing the daily volumes in pops , i didn ' t see any
days with flow under 18 , 000 . so , we should not need a buyback for ena . any
shortages should be allocated to the hpl ticket .

jay ,
let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?
thanks ,

james , thanks for following up on this .
fyi to all , the agreement we have with el paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal ( as well as external ) communication of the transaction :
"" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information . ""
the language stems from a problem we had when east coast power was sold late last year , but probably works to our advantage in this case . suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what ' s coming down the pipe . however , we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible .
thanks ,

with due respect , trust and humility , i use this
medium to write this letter to you irrespective of the fact that you do not know me , but please do consider this letter as a request from a family in dare need of assistance .
let me formally introduce myself . i am duve khumalo , the son of late . dr . robinson khumalo , the renowned zimbabwean wine and cattle ranch farmer .
i got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the south african information exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual / company who can assist me in this business .
during the war waged against the farmers in zimbabwe by the supporters and cohorts of president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country , my late father belonged to one of the classes of farmers targeted by the zanu - pf armed group , because he did not support their ideas and policies .
in the course of the revolution in the country , the zanu - pf armed group attacked and invaded my father ' s farms burning , destroying and eventually killing him . after my father ' s death last year , i managed to escape the boundaries of zimbabwe into south africa with my mother , because our lives were threatened and zimbabwe was no longer safe for us .
we escaped safely into south africa with my father ' s lifetime fortune of us $ 25 ( twenty five million
us dollars ) cash , bonds , important documents of property title and other valuables , which he instructed i his son on before his death . the money and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes , and were transported to netherlands through diplomatic means .
the boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private security and brokerage firm there in netherlands .
presently , i am residing temporarily with my mother in johannesburg pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for the department of home affairs to grant us political asylum .
at the moment , i am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of netherlands for investments . moreover , due to netherlands government ' s stringent monetary policies / regulations and the sensitive and volatile political status of the region , it would be most dangerous to attempt investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances .
in recognition of your personal executive powers and investment opportunities that abound in your country , i solicit for your assistance in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our future arrival for investments .
my mother and i have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a brokerage commission of 20 % of the money .
we have also earmarked 5 % for pre - transfer expenses we may incur in the course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during the transaction are subject to refund .
i have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us .
please let me receive your approval or reply through this my email address ( khumaduvel 01 @ netscape . net ) or phone number above and feel free to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly , send your phone and fax number for easier communication .
if you are unable to assist please be kind to notify me so that i can look for a suitable alternative .
please accept my warm compliments , as i earnestly wait for your urgent response .
best regard ,
duve khumalo

investor alert newsletter - april issue issue 2005
gbic is set to soar this monday !
in april ' s issue we are going to profile a stock that is very much undervalued
and has just started trading . ground floor opportunity for everybody .
this small treasure is : gbic ( gulf biomedical corp )
the stock is trading at only 20 cents and we expect it will hit 50 - 60 cents in
the second week of april
huge pr campaign expected this week so grab as much as you can up to 45 - 55 cents
range
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stock symbol : gbic
current price : $ 0 . 19
we expect the price to go to 50 - 60 cents in next 2 - 3 days
we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
there are some very positive news expected next week so act before that : )
about the company :
60 - million americans are losing - or have already lost - their hair . they are
mostly men , but also a substantial number of women . most of that 60 - milloin wish
they had it back . gulf biomedical corporation ( gbic ) has a breakthrough product
that will help them . no , it will really help them .
there are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing ,
until you read the fine print . the fine print says , "" this doesn ' t work for
everybody . "" it says , "" results may take four months or more to appear . "" it says ,
"" beware of the side effects . "" it says , "" a long term contract is required . ""
gbic has hairmagict . there is no fine print . hairmagict says , plain and simple :
"" hairmagict grows hair . easily . painlessly . inexpensively - for less than $ 2 a
day . results in 4 weeks , or your money back . ""
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stock symbol : gbic
current price : $ 0 . 19
we expect the price to go to 50 - 60 cents in next 2 - 3 days
we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
the product :
the product is hairmagictand it grows hair . no , it really grows hair . how
important is that ?
an estimated 60 million american men and women ( yes , women too ) are losing - or
have already lost - their hair . most of them would give anything to have it
back . people do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really
don ' t . funny ? sure , if you have a full head of hair . if you don ' t , you would
probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your
head .
that ' s what the experts call a "" market ! ""
now , you ' ve seen all the ads . they are full of hair - growing promises , plus
warnings that their product doesn ' t work for everybody , and beware of the side
effects . one promises the buyer will see results , if any , in four months . all of
them cost a veritable fortune .
now , finally , there ' s a hair - growing product that actually grows hair , and
hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less , or give you a 100 %
refund . and , incredibly , hairmagictsells for less than $ 2 a day .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

dear friend ,
i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe .
this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the
interest of the country .
it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum .
i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you .
all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets .
there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country .
we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers .
i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction .
i shall furnish you with more details on request .
yours truly

for you :
september
i need to know if a ticket has been set up for september for the market side
of the williams & apache gas . we still only the supply is in mops . if it
just needs points added to it , just let me know the deal ticket # .
august 31 st
this was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on
lonestar 1023 & 1460 . currently , they do not have the supply points needed
for the williams & apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to
imbalance . . . so i will get them added so this gas can be pathed .
july 31 - aug 7
these days were pathed as buy / sells from tenaska iv to tenaska marketing
ventures .
i worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment ( july &
aug business ) , and had them do a manual entry for aug 31 st .

subject : the houston expl dec 2000
daren :
i ' m not sure if you can help me , but i have a danny conner deal from december 2000 that has a price issue .
we were buying gas from the houston exploration company on black marlin , high island 138 / hpl meter 98663 , deal 508426 . the deal was priced at hsc - 0 . 14 . in december , a new platform came on , high island 115 / hpl meter 986431 . it did not start flowing until the 20 th . danny did not put a new deal in for this meter , so we combined the gas on deal 508426 . the houston exploration thinks that the gas at hi 115 should be kept separate and priced at hsc gd - 0 . 14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20 th . we agree that we received the gas . we have the pipeline statement from black marlin . we just don ' t have the same pricing . the houston exploration shows that we owe them an additional $ 222 k due to this price difference . we only purchased this gas in dec 2000 and jan 2001 . the deal for jan , 547063 , was priced at gd - 0 . 14 . can you verify how this deal should be priced ? i sent this issue to danny back in january and he said the if price was correct , but the houston exploration is sticking to their price . if you need to talk to their trader , his name is lester lipperdt 713 - 830 - 6960 .

subject : re : equistar deal tickets
i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
correctly in unify . currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
and pricing the first 10 , 000 at a certain price and anything over 10 , 000 at a
different price . for example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first , meter
1384 may have 5000 , and meter 1552 may have 5000 . unify currently prices the
first 10 , 000 at a certain price , and 5000 at a different price . this is
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10 , 000 , each meter should be
priced at the first tier level . robert needs to set up one additional sale
ticket and one additional buyback ticket , but he will not schedule gas to
these tickets . anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
she allocates the volumes each month . equistar receives manual invoices each
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice ,
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately . i need to have
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices .
thanks ,

i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation

hear back from daren or julie .
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back

it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the

no new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag . this is on the

k @ the meter .
98 - 9676 sitara deal # 151669 deal good from 1 / 1 / 00 - 1 / 31 / 00 but there is
flow for all of february 2000 with no k . this is on the 215 k for 1 / 2000

i am working on clearing an old txu lone star / gas distribution balance from

have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments . these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland . txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline , however , i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate .

1 , 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8 , 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil . txu shows

howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be waha . hub . gdp . d . a + . 02

it looks like we ' re missing some volume . . . . . . . . . . . .
deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55 , 000 per day allocated . and in sitara this deal should be priced at $ 3 . 0505 .
deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234 , 000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441 , 000 based on the spreadsheet i sent . did you have some conflicting volumes ? i ' m resending what the volumes should be . and the pricing for this should be at waha . hub . gdp . d . a + . 02 .

1370,0,"Subject: tenaska iv agency fee
can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 .
my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further .
thanks ,

subject : gorons
don ' t know who you ' re voting for , but here some things you might want to
consider -
what is a goron
1 . gorons sincerely believe that vice president gore is a true
environmentalist , when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm :
a polluting zinc mine , from which he received $ 500 , 000 of income last
year .
2 . gorons likewise believe that the vp is antismoking and anti - tobacco
when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies .
3 . gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero , when in fact
he was placed by family influence in a "" cushy "" correspondent ' s job and
the only action he saw was that of his brownie camera ! ( and his bong )
4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the
vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .
5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums
of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .
6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "" invent the
internet "" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially incriminating e - mail !
7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were
the models for the book and movie , "" love story "" even though the book ' s
author , erich segal , says not .
8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s
champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million
dollars in occidental petroleum stock .
9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president
clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain
silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton "" one of
the greatest presidents of our history . ""
10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they
won ' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so
ineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of
tennessee ' s senators !
11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man ' s friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum house that he was renting to them .
cautionary note : medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are
generally harmless , except when allowed into a voting booth . there ,
unfortunately , overcome by their gullibility syndrome , they are apt to
actually vote for gore ! they should be carefully protected from their
ailment , since it may be harmful to their well - being , yours , mine and
that of the usa .
therefore , please , heed the surgeon general ' s warning , reach out to
aid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome , and , please , pass this on to
your normal friends , who might also know gorons who need immediate
treatment ."

release
international telephone services ( its ) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients .
its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol ( south of spain ) , then extending this to businesses also based in the area .
as of december 1998 , when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain , its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality . the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls , prepaid calling cards , and intelligent numbers ( 90 x , 800 - type ) .
with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000 , its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain . unfortunately , the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot . com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector . by the end of 2001 , its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to "" ride out the storm . ""
by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value .
as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america .
since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project .
in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center .
the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is :
1 ) building very little "" owned "" infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators .
2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services .
3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions .
the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) .
the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices .
the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain .

business description
its networks / teleconnect has become one of the top four calling card providers in spain . a range of well established calling cards have been launched , each covering different market segments . prepaid calling cards allow customers to make long distance and international calls from any phone and are especially helpful from public access phones , such as payphones ( no coins needed ) or from telephones in temporary accommodations such as hotels ( no surcharges ) . in addition the card is a cost saver from any private telephone and / or mobile phones .
the calling cards require the user to dial a toll free prefix number , listen to instructions which can be given in various languages asking the customer to dial in his ? code ? or ? pin ? , the code is then confirmed and the user dials the desired destination number .
the cards are distributed through various sales channels , and can be purchased at a variety of local merchants , kiosks , etc and are used primarily by tourists , foreign residents , students and immigrants .

please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .

1437,0,"Subject: new enrononline functionality
the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "" fill order "" . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "" no auto inactivate when stack manager is down "" .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose "" keep awake "" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them .

she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

attention : houston - based outlook users
the global messaging team is proud to announce that beginning today , monday july 16 th , houston - based enron employees that have been migrated to outlook will be able to securely access their enron email from anywhere on the web . this means that if you can get on to the internet , you can access your enron email with outlook web access ( owa ) without having to dial in to enron ' s network . please note that this is not available to those users still on lotus notes but will be available once they are migrated to outlook .
once on the internet , type mail . enron . com in your browser address window and supply your enron network logon credentials as username and password . for example :
username : jdoe 4
password : * * * * * * * *
once you log in , outlook web access opens your enron email mailbox . outlook web access ( owa ) allows you to send and receive mail , perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts , as well as access your mailbox folders . at this time , public folders are not accessible via owa . please keep in mind that outlook web access is a browser - based version of what you might use in the office , so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of outlook 2000 may not be available at all . additionally , owa is only supported using internet explorer 5 . x only and not supported with netscape .
outlook web access is the standard email package for connecting to your enron mail from home , whether you are using an enron - issued home pc , an internet connection with your personal home pc , or your clickathome pc . we will not support the use of the full outlook installation for home use .
outlook web access for remote locations and european / apac enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon . at this time , owa is only available if your mailbox resides on a houston mail server .
if you have any questions , please call :

janet and daren ,
attached is a gas supply proposal i receive from duke energy for delivery to the mission interconnect on tetco . they also provided me a quote on tenn , but it was way off base . this deal in combination with swing from net may be a good start for the month of may . the deal provides swing flexibility and would allow us to get our feet wet and see how net operates the mission system when they are not providing all of the delivered gas . let me know what you think . i have had discussions with elpaso / pg thu , 19 apr 2001 14 : 55 : 32 - 0400

did we exchange with panenergy in april ? if we did , can you send me your nom sheet ? meter 7052 - castle busby looks different this month . elsa did some deals with highland energy at 7052 . we normally buy all of the gas from duke at this meter when we exchange . there also wasn ' t flow every day , so duke ' s volume is very small .

mary ,
hplc currently has a gas purchase agreement ( global # 96014987 ) in place with
calpine that extends through 5 / 31 / 2001 . sitara deal no . 133259 correctly has
this contract attached to it . effective 11 / 1 / 1998 the contract was amended
releasing gouger wells no . 5 & 6 . these wells were apparently the only
producing wells behind this point . evidence being no measured volumes in
mips . there are however other non producing wells behind this point . is
your sept
however , they were not added behind meter 6835 . therefore , i do not agree
that the deal ( 133259 ) should be edited to change the meter .
hopefully this information is useful !

fyi - here is the message from mary poorman in logistics .
mary ,
cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas
flow on the meter .

kathy and i are trying to clean up an unaccounted for issue at the above
referenced meter . the system ( pops ) does not show a bav flow or an actual
flow for prior months . kathy phoned measurement to inquire about mips
volumes and was informed that this meter is on a disabled status list back to
february , 2000 . i am showing a purchase from calpine at this meter ( deal
ticket 133259 ) on gathering agreement
i would greatly appreciate your help in determining the current status of
this meter and this deal . please forward any information you may have .
thank you for your time and patience ,

i have created two new deals in sitara . you will need to get with someone in
volume management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals
for jan - sep . the logistics group will be able to adjust october forward .
deal # s :
144052 - - > 440092
144049 - - > 440093
let me know if you have any questions .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

i have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?
thanks ,

subject : eol deal ids in path manager
as you ' re aware , we ' re having to bridge houston street ids into unify from
sitara .
we are being asked , as a requirement , to not display the eol id on statements
that are identified as "" broker eol trade "" deals originating from eol . we
have two options to accomodate this requirement :
option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the eol
deal id if the deal is a "" broker eol trade "" deal . one of the drawbacks of
this option is that you won ' t be able to referenence the eol id on the path
manager for these related deals . all other deals will have the eol deal id ,
if applicable . the eol id would not show up on the statements because it
wouldn ' t be populated .
option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the settlements area which may
be more time consuming . the obvious code change would be in the statement
generation area as well as other report type information .
option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while option 1 may be quicker to
implement .
please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback . please
share your thoughts . . . .
i ' ve attached an email explaining the broker eol trades . this is not to be
confused with broker deals done at a given point with not transportation .
these will continue to come across as you ' d normally expect .
any questions , please ask . . .
thanks !"

please take note of dave ' s very important message regarding sitara
positions . we absolutely cannot afford to go through this again and need to
do everything possible to help limit the exposure . with prices where they
are and winter weather upon us we will most likely have a very challenging
bid week .
that being said i want each of you to make sure we adhere to the "" daily
clean "" process . you should pull all the necessary reports each day and keep
after the schedulers to make sure they are up to date . if you wish , donna and
richard can make these available each day and distribute to the group . we
don ' t have much time so this needs to happen immediately .
donna , please provide me with a daily summary of all the desks for the
remainder of the month .
let me know if you have any questions or concerns , thanks - bob

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
continue to have the unify data "" cleaned / scrubbed "" week to week and try to
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to
have 2 months "" active "" at a time . in other words , when november is over and
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in
the past .
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .
thanks , d . n ."

nick ,
i am not sure what happened to this volume . i cannot tell by the audit
trail , but there is a connection between meter hpl meter 987283 , and midt
989807 . the volume you are referring to is on mid - tex pipeline under meter
989807 . it it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference . i do
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser . the volume is in mips under meter 989807 , but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter 987283 , and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
was moved from midt to hpl . get with thu when she returns to see if she

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .

gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and

charlotte ,
there is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2 / 99 . it appears the
variance is created on 2 / 9 / 99 and 2 / 10 / 99 . there is a transport usage deal
ticket 72893 in sitara which shows pg & e delivers 6 , 965 mmbtu to hpl on 2 / 9 / 99
and 3 , 683 mmbtu on 2 / 10 / 99 , but hpl does not show a receipt of this volume .
let me know if you need the pg & e support ."
1561,0,"Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy
today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .
deal terms
- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .
- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .
- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .
- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .
enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .
management of newly formed company
chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .
i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .
management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .
the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .
as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .
i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .
i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .
and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .
investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ; or investor relations , enron corp . , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3002 .
in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered "" participants in the solicitation "" of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron ."

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

super viagra , or cialis is used to treat erectile dysfunction , also known as impotence .
this is when a man cannot get , or keep , a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity .
the active ingredient in cialis tablets , tadalafil , belongs to a group of medicines called
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors . following sexual stimulation cialis helps the blood
vessels in your penis to relax which allows the blood flow into your penis . the result is
the improved erectile function . cialis will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction .

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
10 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed @ gd hsc high

i updated the june transport usage tickets today through hpl , and will be
finishing these tickets tomorrow . rates have been updated to reflect current
matrix rates and all baseload rates that i know of at this time . i have not
yet received third party transport rates , so if you know of any , please let
me know . also , i have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for june , so
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them . rule of thumb
was that if i had to add a month , i refreshed the rate but left volume at
zero . if the months were already on the ticket , then i refreshed the rate
and left the volume as is .
i would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
they ' re reflected in position manager correctly . please let me know if you
have any questions . all pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning .

limit . once you reach 100 mb , you will be prevented from sending email , but
you will still be able to receive internal and external messages you will
then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail , saving
attachments to a local drive , etc . before you will be able to send an email
again .
3 . from the day of migration , only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from
your mailbox . this includes mail in your inbox and other folders . calendar

lee can confirm the accuracy of this , but bmc bought 20 , 000 from us and
intended no swing and no buyback . brandywine ( dorcheus ) controlled the meter ,
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders . i

lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

company ) markets a unique air spring suspension system , airspring axle , that
allows small to medium - sized trailers to be lowered to near flush with the
ground , greatly improving the safety and ease with which heavy cargo can be

over 2 million small to medium
sized trailers are sold annually in the us .

initial market for the company ' s air spring axle system is $ 10 - $ 15 million .
there are thousands of trailer rental locations in the us , and the system can
improve customer satisfaction , safety and labor requirements . dtomi is working
with a leading home improvement conducting a four - month test of 50 trailers .

the total market will grow to
$ 140 million as the system is licensed to trailer manufacturers .
dtomi plans to assist manufacturers with
integration of the air spring axle system into existing trailer designs , and to
collaborate with them on marketing efforts . management expects licensing fees of
$ 200 - $ 300 per trailer .

to all employees :
this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses :
- - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner .
- - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing .
- - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion .
- - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline .
these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so .
as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer .
for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination .
i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions .
when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities .
on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future .

matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .
all :
please respond via e - mail with any comments .

1755,0,"Subject: pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .
please give me a call if you have any questions ."

there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform

daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda
needs . i am confused about praxair though .
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

1810,0,"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments ."

1851,0,"Subject: texas general land office it transport
gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?

lee ,
i did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120 - 125 bbtu / day of
fuel
gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas
requirements
down to essentially zero ( it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down )
and
the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas . we will be in this
arrangement for approximately 20 days .

daren , sitara has two different prices for may 31 , 2001 causing a problem .
according to lee papayoti , the price for the swing volumes should
behsc _ flw + 1 high . gdp . d . a . however it is priced at hsc . gdp . d . a with the 31 st
being priced at both . this is causing settlements to be overstated by
419 mmbtu and $ 1 , 432 . 66 . any help you could give would be greatly

the accomplishments by 6 / 19 is for directors and above - to sally .
individual groups under sally will probably set their deadlines prior to the
smaller prc ' s . that is correct .
i did not understand that promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting
with sally our notes indicate that sally wanted some prior discussions on
this subject . nor did i understand that the employee had to be in their
role for 1 year . our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of
thumb . i thought the promotion discussion would be an agenda item of prc .
we believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the prc .
additionally , i understood the mid - year promotion listing would not be as
extensive as year - end , maintaining the year - end as the primary promotion
time . we understood the same .

subject : re : prc meeting agenda recap
i think i ' m unclear on some points .
the accomplishments by 6 / 19 is for directors and above - to sally .
individual groups under sally will probably set their deadlines prior to the
smaller prc ' s .
i did not understand that promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting
with sally nor did i understand that the employee had to be in their role for
1 year . i thought the promotion discussion would be an agenda item of
prc . additionally , i understood the mid - year promotion listing would not be
as extensive as year - end , maintaining the year - end as the primary promotion
time .
can you clarify ? thanks .

look thru the sequence history . the meter # on the opposite side did not change
even though the pipe code did . that is all i have to suggest .

i need to get the approval from daren farmer ext . 3 - 6905 . please feel
free to contact him to discuss this matter .
also , i do not believe the meter no . will be the same . i searched pi
grid and it shows hpl with drn 92686 interconnect with meter no .
237 - 07 - 1 - 004 , drn 26879 for teco pipeline co .
we have discrepencies / isssues .
what verifying information do you have for this meter ?

good afternoon !
no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this
morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them
along .
kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :
he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding
the problem .
before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of
your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to
see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep
this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .
another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment
gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !
a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips .
talk to you again in a few weeks .

greg , this relates to the seven oaks tailgate accounting issue we have been
discussing . hplr once had an appropriate agreement in place , but that
agreement has been assigned to ect . until the agreement can be re - assigned
from ect to hplc , we will use spot gtcs to clear the puchase / sale accounts
for the period from 10 / 98 to 6 / 99 or perhaps 7 / 99 .

enron capital meter no . : 6884
julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments ?
when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?
thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional
information .
cc ' s :
let me know if something i stated is incorrect or if anyone has any
additional information ."

everybody ' s hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off . although

not be charged to your rc even though you and your employees use ernie to

1967,0,"Subject: re : fuel
we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get
the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price . can the
downstream systems , scheduling etc handle this ?"

dear friend ,
permit me to inform you of my desire of going into
business relationship with you .
i am mr andy monga , the only son of late mr and mrs
banabas monga . my father was a very wealthy cocoa
merchant in abidjan , the economic capital of ivory
coast , my father was poisoned to death by his business
associates in one of their outings on a business trip .
my mother died when i was a baby and since then , my
father took me so special . before the death of my
father on january 2002 in a private hospital here in
abidjan , he secretly called me on his bedside and told
me that he has the sum of eighteen million , five
hundred
thousand us dollars ( us $ 18 , 500 , 000 ) left in a fixed /
suspense account in one of the prime banks here in
abidjan , that he used my name as his only son for the
next of kin in depositing the fund . he also
explained to me that it was because of this wealth
that he was poisoned by his business associates . that
i should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where i will transfer this money and use it for
investment purpose such as real estate management or
hotel management .
i am honourably seeking your assistance in the
following ways :
1 ) to serve as a guardian of this fund since i am only
20 years old
2 ) to make arrangement for me to come over to your
country to further my education and to secure a
resident permit for me in your country .
moreover , i am willing to offer you 15 % of the
total sum as compensation for your effort / input after
the successful transfer of this fund into your
nominated account overseas and 5 % for expenses .
furthermore , you indicate your options towards
assisting me as i believe that this transaction would
be concluded within ( 24 ) days you signify
interest to assist me .

per conversation with rosa brown and thu ( in volumes management , beaumont methanol is a swing deal , by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr . thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428 .
do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter # 981428 ? if so , can you confirm 02 - 01 sales ( on hpl , meter # 981428 . , sales deal # 603107 ) , to beaumont methanol ( which we ' ve invoiced them ) , vs . chyral hankins ' e - mial to buddy majorwitz below ? the only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02 - 13 - 01 ( she reflects noms of 0 vs . the 3 , 811 mmbtu that we invoiced them ) .
thanks ,

sitara which shows hplc transporting on midcon from live oak to hardy street

a zero rate , however . elsa / daren - do either of you remember this deal ? it

tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big
cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase
this gas at "" hpl meters "" at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been
pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes
have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom
and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and
determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im
wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu
tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective
april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .
please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or

from : mr . richard mayer
dear friend ,
i am mr . richard mayer , the accountant general of nedbank of south
africa . i request your co - operation in the transfer of money amounting to
u . s . d . 32 million .
on september 2001 , an american pilot , mr . roy kenob , an american ational
made a fixed deposit of u . s d 32 million in ned bank of south africa . on
maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but gotno
reply . after a month , i sent a reminder and finally his employers
wrote to inform us that mr . kenob died in a plane crash , that he died without
making a will while our attempt to trace his next of kin through american
embassy proved fruitless .
when he was making deposition in my bank , he did not declare his next of
kin in his deposit application form , when i reminded him he said he
wished it so , in the conservative manner of our bank , i did not turn down
his request rather honor it considering his high net worth . the point is
that his employer are not aware of his deposit with us , therefore i am the
only person who know about mr . roy ' s deposit of u . s . d 32 , 000 , 000 . 00 which
is now lying in dormant account portfolio , the whole account relating to
mr . kenob ' s deposit is also with me .
i am looking forward for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of
kin to mr . roy . i have worked out modalities of achieving my aim by
appointing you as the next of kin to mr . roy as well as transfer the u . s . d
32 , 000 , 000 . 00 abroad for us to share . i will use an attorney who will represent
you as the beneficiary to execute series a written will and attestament
of late mr . roy kenob , in support of your claim including certificate of
origin of the money , letter of probate which empowers you as the sole trustee / executor
to the estate of mr . roy kenob . please note that you will not be required
to sign any transfer document , as the appointed attorney will do all
that .
if you agree to act as the next of kin / beneficiary to enable me
transfer / convert the money to our own benefit / use . i will give you 30 % of
usd 32 m , 60 % will be for me while 10 % will be to take care of all unforeseen
expenses as we may incure in the course of concluding this transaction .
i am urgently waiting for your positive reply on the address below .

daren :
i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the

advice as  + pvacation  , .
? flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead
of as a credit in the deduction section . the various benefit deductions will
remain itemized in the deduction section .
? if you transfer between enron companies during the year , your year  ) to - date
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice . previously , the
year - to - date totals started over when transferred to another company . this

payroll faq  , s
my paycheck has a line called  & other deductions  8 , what does that stand for ?
there is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck . for
some employees , the number of deductions are more than we have room to
print . in this circumstance , the system totals all remaining deductions and
prints them on one line  ) titled  & other deductions  8 . the detail of all
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet

what do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean ?
these definitions are listed on the payroll webpage located at
hrweb . enron . com , select enron payroll from the side index .
why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck ?
overtime is paid one pay period in arrears , therefore it will be reflected in
the next pay period . for example , if you reported overtime for the
july lst  ) 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay advice
as  + povertime  , .
what is the limit for social security ( fica ) ?
for year 2000 the limit is $ 4 , 724 . 40 on a wage base of $ 76 , 200 . this limit is
applied to each enron payroll tax company . therefore , if you transfer to
another enron company these limits will start over , however , the total amount
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub . excess fica
will be credited to you by the irs via your tax return .
what federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when i exercise stock
options ?
there is a standard federal income tax rate of 28 % for these earnings . this
can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form
requesting a higher rate ( this form can be found at hrweb . enron . com , select

2110,0,"Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 )
fred or anita ,
i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121
is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate
flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was
put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the
gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at
meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter
statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .
for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957
and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer
martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use
449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed
out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate
for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the
allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .
in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a
callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general
land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on
that yet .
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be
doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person
doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !"

here is my problem . as you know , hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude . the problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude . bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc , ena and egm that would book the deal correctly . julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february , except for one small part , but march forward was never completed . the attached word document explains the procedure . basically , we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price . this would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo . then , we would book a sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - wellhead for the value of the gas only ( no volume ) and a sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude ( no volume ) . for these deals , we would use demand fees . egm will pay ena for the crude dollars .
i will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move . you will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo . julie zeroed this out , but o ' neal put it back . i ' ve left him a message to find out why .

a volume of 6 , 289 mmbtu flowed over the noms for cp & l . i don ' t have a record
of a spot deal with them for that day .
gary - currently , that volume has been allocated to the term agreement . the
price difference on that day is significant . ( hsc gd mid was 5 . 245 ) . if you
don ' t have a record of a spot deal , the allocation should stand as it is .

hi there
hope you don ' t mind me contacting you , but i thought you may be interested
in
this , as like me , you are obviously serious about making some money . . .
i have heard nothing but great things about this . so give it a shot .
 5 . . . that ' s all it takes . . .
i ' ll keep it short and sweet .
to get started just right mouse click and copy this whole page and paste it
in an
e - mail to edit it .
once i got started the money started rolling in ! ! ! just like the plan below
said it would !
i am currently getting over  200 a day and just started
weekago ! ! ! ! !
believe it or not , this is my 2 nd time around . simply follow the
instructions below and in 2 to 3 weeks , you will have at least  20 , 000 in
your
paypal account .
most people respond to this program because of the low investment (  5 ) and
high profit potential . the return rate is currently 50 % to 80 % . there is no
limit
to the income you can generate from this business ( you can do it over and
over ) . this program is the fastest , easiest program you will ever do .
the only down fall is when people try to put their address in the # 1 place .
if
they do that they will only reach the people they initially send to , and
only
make a few pounds .
if you follow the instructions you will reach thousands of people ! honesty ,
faith and integrity make this system work .
team work makes the dream work ! lets get started !
i think everyone has heard of "" paypal "" ( if not you will ) . paypal ( owned by
ebay ) is the simplest method of making and receiving payments online . anyone
with
an email address can join for free ! if you ' re not already a paypal user , the
first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up for free :
use the link above to sign up for a free account , then send a  5 . 00 donation
from
your paypal account ( you will earn back  5 . 00 from paypal , for signing up
anyway ! ) to only the first email address on the list along with a note
saying : "" please add me to your mailing list "" .
now send an email to the 4 th person on the list saying "" thanks i ' ve joined "" .
then , remove the first email address and place your address at the bottom .
this
should move the second place into the first place and the third place into
second and fourth into the third .
don ' t try to place yourself in the first place .
it will only reach the people you send it to , and then your name will be
removed from the lst place by that person and this will not make the system
work .
if you do this the way it was designed it will reach thousands by the time
your name gets to the top . remember to only send a  5 . 00 donation to the
first
e - mail address , and send "" thanks i ' ve joined "" to the fourth person . this
lets the
4 th person keep track of their progress .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
1 . siberiantigergrowl @ hotmail . com
2 . jemimajones _ 7 @ hotmail . com
3 . @ hotmail . com
4 . nic @ madstock . freeserve . co . uk
now that you have made your donation to the first person and sent the fourth
person a note , place your email address in the fourth place ( make sure its
the
same email address you used for your paypal account ) this is the way you
will
receive payment .
ok , the only thing left to do is email out at least 20 copies or more ( ! ) of
this
letter in a week or so . when your name reaches the top of the list it will
be
your turn to collect your money from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people just like
yourself
who are willing to spend  5 . 00 and half an hour of there time to receive
 20 , 000
in cash ! keep in mind . . . the most you ' ve spent is  5 .
testimonials : d . rayner london : i only have one thing to say to
you . . . . oh my god ! i sent out 40 copies like the instructions said and left on
holiday . when i got back my account had over  12 , 000 in it already ! i ' m
still
floating on air ( especially with my new car i bought ! ) !
thanks !
this programe works , it really does .
so good luck to the rest of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"

pardon the abruptness and the liberty of this
letter ; it is due to its exigency .
i am a bank official in the uk . i write to ask for your help .
i am in need of a foreign partner to assist in the transfer of a
considerable amount of money .
what we require is someone who is reliable and trustworthy , who has a vision
and who will be able to manage whatever business in which we shall inject
venture capital . we need someone who can share our dreams and ideals .
i have the legal title to the sum and we shall go through the legal
procedures entailed in both our laws and international laws in transferring
the funds to you in trust .
please do not at this point misunderstand my intention , because
understandably , we are not acqainted . i do not even know if you will be
reliable and trustworthy , but i believe that everything starts with a first
step . i know that i need to explain everything clearly to you before you can
come to a decision as to whether you can assist me or not , and i will do
this as soon as i get a response from you .
i am sure that with the insider information i can provide , we will with your
help , conclude the transaction within 7 working days . in consideration for
your assistance , we have agreed to give you the normal transaction
commission obtainable of 10 % of the total sum , and another 5 % if you can
successfully put together an investment portfolio for us , as we will like to
invest some of this money in your country , rather than leave it idle in a
bank account .
if you can be of assistance , please write to me for more information ,
otherwise , i thank you for your patience .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

extracted from the march 2005 - 1 issue
elgin
is in the process of merging with jonpol to create a company with substantial
platinum interests and near - term production potential .
the combined company will have in excess of 12 million
ounces of platinum group metals to its credit , all in the measured and
indicated resource category . most importantly , both of the main deposits that
will initially be held by the new company are presently headed toward early
development .
both of elgins projects are on the eastern limb of
the bushveld complex in south africa . the bushveld is the worlds most
important source of platinum , producing two thirds of the world ' s supply of the
precious metal .
the elgin deposits have grades and other attributes
comparable to nearby profitable operating mines . they have the added benefit of
being located at a shallow depth , with plans to begin mining one of the
deposits as an open pit . by taking advantage of nearby infrastructure , elgin can develop the mines quickly and at modest capital costs .

i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being "" good friday "" and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .

2231,0,"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization - revised
revision in bold . pass on to any who may need this .
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a deal for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent . the agent
contract will get cleared . re - select the agent contract .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the pipeline contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .
thanks , d . n ."

ow ,
i went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves / mapping we can delete ( yellow ) and those we can change ( orange ) . the only curves we will have left are katy , waha , hsc , agua dulce , and thompsonville . i expect to be using thompsonville in 6 months to a year . if it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it , that will be fine . let me know if you have any questions .

hey gang ,
attached are the physical curve mappings as provided by russ severson . . . please take a peek and let us know if we need to change , add / delete , update any points / mappings going forward in a netco environment . . . for instance , i would like to change texoma to carthage on the curve mappings . . . also , i would like to delete all derived curves , leaving only carthage , katytailgate , and agua dulce .
the other physical locations would be shipchannel , waha and katy ( non - tailgate ) . . . let me know your thoughts . . . o ' neal 3 - 9686

it looks like we will be making our bammel true - up payment to aep in the next couple of days . included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas . we are selling them 1 , 236 , 286 mmbtu @ $ 2 . 375 for a total of $ 2 , 936 , 179 . 25 . the sale is for september , 2001 production . we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics . however , there is only 1 , 195 , 754 mmbtu on report 006 in unify ( for contracts 96018371 , 96014189 , and 96019236 ) . how do we account for this volumetic difference ? connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume . the gl was short approx . 18 , 000 mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked .
this needs to happen before the upcoming close .
thanks for you help in this matter .

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a "" synergi "" contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

dear partner ,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .
i await your response ,

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

2321,0,"Subject: change of control provisions
as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .
many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .
i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .

to claim as the beneficiary of the funds , efforts has been made by union bank of nigeria to get in touch with the baker ' s family or relative but to no success .
based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate engnieer theopilus ' s next - of - kin , the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown
account .
it is based on this that we have contacted you to stand as the next - of - kin of late engr . theopilus baker so that the funds , will be released and paid into your account
as the beneficiary and the next - of - kin to the deceased . all documents , and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as we have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account . it has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 20 % of the remitted funds , while we keep 75 % and 5 % will be set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes .

we will have to find an alternate method to swing the volume . based on our

we
can swing on them . in the short term , however , we are going to have to make
due

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .
1 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 1 demand fee from $ 341 , 250 . 47 to $ 493 , 365 . 74

if you assisted in the completion of the opm hours survey in the past and / or
are expected to in the future , you will need access to microsoft access
beginning wednesday , september 27 , 2000 . if you do not have microsoft
access , please go to the enron . itcentral . com website and complete an it
application request for microsoft access as soon as possible .
if you are not the individual who will be updating the hours surveys , please
( 1 ) coordinate with the individual who will and ( 2 ) notify suzanne nicholie
at # 57341 .
on wednesday , september 27 , 2000 a new hours survey will be distributed to
you and will be due for completion on wednesday , october 4 , 2000 .
we have developed what we think to be an easier and more efficient method of
handling the hours survey using microsoft access . the hours survey is menu
driven and you are not expected to need specific microsoft access training .
we will provide help lines and as needed direct training with the roll out of
the new hours survey . if you have any questions please contact anyone in the
opm group .

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the

until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is

jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the

your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena

subject : tribute to america
subject : tribute to america
i needed to read this in light of yesterday ' s events . . . . .
tribute to the united states
this , from a canadian newspaper , is worth sharing .
america : the good neighbor .
widespread but only partial news coverage was given
recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
toronto by gordon sinclair , a canadian television
commentator . what follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional
record :
"" this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
americans as the most generous and possibly the
least appreciated people on all the earth . germany ,
japan and , to a lesser extent , britain and italy
were lifted out of the debris of war by the
americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts .
none of these countries is today paying even the
interest on its remaining debts to the united
states . when france was in danger of collapsing in
1956 , it was the americans who propped it up , and
their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of paris . i was there . i saw it .
when earthquakes hit distant cities , it is the
united states that hurries in to help . this spring ,
59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes .
nobody helped . the marshall plan and the truman
policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
countries . now newspapers in those countries are
writing about the decadent , warmongering americans .
i ' d like to see just one of those countries that is
gloating over the erosion of the united states
dollar build its own airplane . does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
boeing jumbo jet , the lockheed tri - star , or the
douglas dcl 0 ?
if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the
international lines except russia fly american
planes ? why does no other land on earth even
consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you
talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .
you talk about german technocracy , and you get
automobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,
and you find men on the moon - not once , but several
times - and safely home again .
you talk about scandals , and the americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued
and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most
of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are
getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to
spend here .
when the railways of france , germany and india were
breaking down through age , it was the americans who
rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the
new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an
old caboose . both are still broke .
i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced
to the help of other people in trouble . can you name
me even one time when someone else raced to the
americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was
outside help even during the san francisco
earthquake .
our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one
canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around . they will come out of this thing
with their flag high . and when they do , they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada
is not one of those . ""
stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !
this is one of the best editorials that i have ever
read regarding the united states . it is nice that
one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of
the world would realize it . we are always blamed for
everything , and never even get a thank you for the
things we do .
i would hope that each of you would send this to as
many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am
just a single american that has read this , tribute to
the united states

as i mentioned to you yesterday , it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert ' s origination fee deducted . do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery ?
also isn ' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo ? is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting ?

recent price $ 0 . 71
tirr is up over 70 % in the past two weeks ! ! !
tradestar corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have profited nicely .
the company
tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america . new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over 90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas @ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again ! using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! ! with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign , experienced management team , and application of cutting edge ep technologies , we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk to the company ! ! ! !
previous news

why we love this stock
1 . continued rise in world oil gas prices !
2 . over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific barnett shale of central texas
3 . strong industry investment banking relationships
4 . strong management - over 50 years of experience in the oil patch
5 . multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners

7 . business model offers only real solution to u . s . dependency on foreign oil .
8 . the company recently proposed a joint venture project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with est . reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas !
conclusion
tradestar corp . ( tirr ) is getting ready to become a major presence in oil gas fields across texas . tirr ' s potential for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the barnett shale , position the stock for immediate upward movement ! ! ! we believe that tirr is in position to take the petroleum industry by storm . the company ' s resource development is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in the near future . revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last year . don ' t miss this fantastic opportunity . for more information on tirr , go to tradestar - corp . com for sec filings or press releases .

2455,0,"Subject: california energy crisis
california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron ' s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a "" turnback "" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :
? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .
? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .
? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .
enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .
increasing supply
california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state ."

the lakecreek lateral is baseload for the expected load , the set point may
change up and down in anticipation of weather changes but pressure supply for
entex is provided via the copano 12 "" , entex shouldcommunicate with us
directly .

subject : re : copano
that is not what i am conveying . there may be changes made to the set flow
periodically , but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of
the copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their
system . whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city
gate , our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that
same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline . our
instructions should only come from entex to change the set point , and should
be confirmed with copano . we are not to provide any instantaneous swing
service on the copano lake creek lateral . any swing provided by hpl for the
woodland ' s load will be made into the copano 12 "" ( formerly ksc ) line as
historically done . there may be additional capacity needed on the lake creek
lateral because of the revised set point , but that is something that entex
has negotiated with copano independent of hpl . still fuzzy ?

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,

tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this .

instead of going to the haunted house , we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved . the weather is going to nice and cool , so the
plan is to have a fire , eat and then play "" capture the flag "" . we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side . the goal of the game is to find your team ' s flag
and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people ' s personalities . if
you aren ' t up to playing the game , then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours .

effective 3 / 1 / 2001 , hplc amended its contract with royal production changing
the price to 100 % hsc less $ 0 . 16 and extending the term through 2 / 28 / 02 .
consequently , for march , hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at
meter 5310 . effective april , hplc amended the same contract releasing the
l . g . talbert # 2 lease in the committed reserves agreement ; mike morris is the
gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000 mmbtu / d . for april i nom
1132 / d ; bob , we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
"" bean - counter "" and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,
sharon

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

investor financial times report
specializing in undervalued small cap stocks for immediate breakout
erhc and exxon mobil exercise priority rights on highly sought after oil
blocks in nigeria and sao tome ' s joint development zone ( jdz ) in the
gulf of guinea .
every major news wire service worldwide has carried hundreds of articles
revealing that the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10 to 15
billion barrels of oil . the jdz line - up tipped to take over upcoming
blocks includes exxon mobil , erhc , chevron texaco , amerada hess ,
and anadarko .
license approval for the region ' s exclusive economic zone ( eez ) is a
multilateral deal securing blocks jointly involving exxon mobil , erhc ,
and chevron texaco .
erhc has jumped from a . 25 cent stock earlier in the year to a . 50 cent
stock that is headed for over $ 2 or a possible buyout from one of their
jdz multinational players .
erhc has been at the negotiating tables with the super - major oil
companies . it is impossible to measure the power that is carried where a
stock at this price level is a vital part of a key union of oil giants !
the top - level executives of the jdz oil majors have been finalizing the
percentage awards with erhc for official announcement of the
landmark - licensing round in the first 2 weeks of june .
the us government is pushing for increasing development of the area to
minimize middle east dependence . the eyes of the world are watching with
record prices at the pump and oil busting through $ 40 per barrel .
the oil companies will always make their $ billions - investors can cash
in by accumulating a substantial position just before earth - shattering
news is released that will send shock waves through erhc .

subject : sitara eol bridge problem today
the problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets ( 2098073 , 2099764 ) not having startdate and enddate . missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up . ( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .
the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .

ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab"

subject : re : meter 5892
daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

2644,0,"Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance
this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma -
beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) .
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february .
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month .
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere
around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is
this still the plan ? ?
we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would
deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting
was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how
conservative
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our
midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil
beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our
maintenance .
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle
gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells
mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule
will change !

in light of december ' s allocation of actual volumes at kcs # 9797 , it looks as
though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at tejas riverside ,
# 3543 , where the "" sell "" portion of this buy / sell occurs for the remainder of
january . december actual receipts at # 9797 were 15 , 889 mm or an average of
513 mm / day . the january nomination is 864 mm / day . i think it needs to be
reduced to approx 345 mm / day effective 1 / 11 or there may be a large diffence
between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to kcs at
tejas riverside . any info you could get from gas control or kcs about actual

salaries , salaries , salaries ! ! ! everyone is having problems .
unfortunately , many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your

salary for each of the different staffing levels . i have asked the hr
department to also give me
the low and the high . let ' s face it - your staff today and their salary most
likely are not what
they are going to be next year ! to much movement of people . so using
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels .
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) make a list of your staff just their positions .
2 ) then put down if you think i should budget high , mid , average , low , low to
average , etc .
you can guess at this based on their experience , length of time in that
position , etc .
3 ) then i will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget .
4 ) here is the average :
sr . $ 4 , 961
spec $ 3 , 964
staff $ 3 , 026
sr . clrk $ 2 , 548
clerk $ 2 , 264
asst $ 3 , 162

clerk very high
sr . clerk low

nomad international inc . ( ndin )
a multi - national internet communications company developing cost
effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip )
technologies .
shares outstanding : 34 , 0 oo , 000
float : 4 , 000 , 0 oo
current price : o . 09
wiil it continue higher ? watch this one friday as we know many of you
like momentum .
breaking news ! !
may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - teievision and teiecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would reguiate voice over internet protoco |
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
sustainable competition in | ocal teiephone markets , the incumbent carriers
wiil not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifie competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cabie companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad
internationa | inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dia | - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 200 , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 4 o , 0 oo , 00 o ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dia | - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users woridwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potentia | for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptabie product .
about nomad international inc .
nomad international inc . is a muiti - national internet communications
company deveioping cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technoiogies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line ca | | ed nomad systems that has dia | - up , broadband , dsl ,
cable , sate | | ite and wireless capabilities . the company pians on
targeting : 1 ) national fixed | ine ii iii tier carriers which are interested in
effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketpiace ,
2 ) large muitinationa | corporations which need to have us or european
presence by having , ( for exampie ) , a united states number ringing in
their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more
economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a
means of significantiy | owering their communication expense with their
reiatives in their country of origin .
conclusion :
the exampies above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
aiready famiiiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and piease watch

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer

it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s
juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday ,
november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the
board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for
this year ' s fundraising efforts .
as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself .
even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of
complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it
they would die .
enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money
raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise
$ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team
leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the

know the details of the extension on the transition agreement ? are you
available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you
think should be included ? ( john griffith has asked to be included and

the mid - year performance management cycle will begin on may 15 with the
opening of the pep system ( the online "" performance evaluation process ""
feedback system ) . you will be receiving your password for this system in a
note to go out later from pep . in preparation for the cycle , four training
classes will be offered to all new employees and to those employees who have
not previously attended training . enrollment for these classes will be
offered through the development center "" ernie "" system . for employees who are
outside the houston area , please contact your hr representative for more
information .
these sessions will be held on :
wednesday , may 10 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . , and three sessions to be held on
thursday , may 11 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . ; 1 : 30 - 2 : 30 p . m . ; and 3 : 00 - 4 : 00 p . m .
all sessions will be held at the doubletree hotel .
to register , click on this link to go directly to the development center
for those of you who have attended the training before and who are familiar
with the past performance management process , there have been some
modifications :
1 . the performance management process is now enron wide . all enron feedback
forms have been reduced to three ( vice president ( vp ) / managing director
( md ) ; management / professional ; and administration / support ) , which all use
the following criteria :
? innovation / entrepreneurship
? communication / setting direction
? teamwork / interpersonal
? leadership / vision / values
? business instinct
? analytical / technical
2 . the following six performance ratings will be used consistently on the
final feedback forms across enron :
superior
excellent
strong
satisfactory
needs improvement
issues
3 . there will be four recognized peer groups across the company for purposes
of the prc ( formerly the business review meetings ) meeting .
? commercial
? commercial support
? technical
? specialized technical
4 . the performance review process will continue to be used to facilitate :
? promotions - up to director level only . there will be no officer promotions
to vp / md at mid - year
? feedback to employee
? compensation decisions
? sharing of performance rating at manager  , s discretion
5 . prc meetings will be reviewed by both functional area & business units
both functional areas and business units will participate in the rating of
employees to cover both solid and dotted line reporting relationships .
functional prc meetings will take place first , followed by the final business
unit meetings . difference in views on an individual employee  , s rating should
be discussed and consensus should be reached . the functional area meetings
are :
- accounting
- human resources
- government affairs
- rac
- global finance
6 . the pep system is now available via the intranet to allow greater access
from global locations and remotely . the functionality is essentially the
same . if you would like further information on how to use this system you may
gain access to the quick reference guide by clicking on the attached
weblinkhttp : / / home . enron . com / announce / . pdf . if the
quick reference does not display correctly on your pc , call your help desk
for assistance , or irma alvarez at 713 - 853 - 1543 to get a hard copy .
7 . the general responsibilities remain the same regarding the overall
process :
employee / reviewer responsibilities :
select 5 - 7 reviewers
complete self - assessment
complete requested feedback forms
reviewers who cannot provide feedback use the decline request feature
supervisor responsibilities :
approve reviewers ( at least 3 of the employee ' s choices )
communicate modifications to employee
participate in prc meetings as required
summarize feedback and complete appropriate feedback form
communicate feedback to the employee

aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron
$ . 0025 / transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier .

that sounds great . because of the accrual , i cannot draft this today . i
will try it on monday . what about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska
iv . do you think that is a good idea ? i explained it to kris hanson and she
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable . we would need a new
demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of
$ 2 , 803 , 586 . 41 with no volume and no commodity . this is more than we owe
tenaska iv , but i will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $ 0 . 04 demand
fee to pay a net amount of $ 1 , 551 , 050 . 76 . i have attached my spreadsheet
which details our payment . we will have to adjust this number once we get
the actual volumes . i would like to pay tenaska iv next week , so please let

subject : hpl optimization
team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .
regards ,
brian"

here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the
highest index .

please read brian ' s memo below . we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting . i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the 2000 plan allocations . please note that we were not making
changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet . rather they are reflected on the 1 / 00
allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .
i need each of you to review the 2000 plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today , and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for 1 / 00 . what
has your group spent their time on in 1 / 00 ? ? ? please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .
one other thing to note : the network trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups : trading ( tom martin and jim schwieger ) and
transportation ( ed gottlob ) . although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown , please include it in yours .
i would like you allocations back to me no later than thursday , 1 / 20 @

subject : 2000 plan allocations and january allocations
the attached files contain the allocation percentages for 2000 plan , january
2000 actuals and a description of the new assets teams .
please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the
assets team . the assets team is now broken out into the following "" groups ""
which are described in the attached word document :
rc # team name rc owner
the 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams , please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets ( which is in the
executive column ) and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support . i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain , which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group . consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination . i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion .
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 2000
actuals . i have added the new rc ' s that we have set up since plan has been
complete , so please make sure you have each rc 100 % allocated .
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday
january 19 th , and the updated january 2000 percentages returned to me by end
of day friday january 21 st .
thanks for your help in getting these updated .

2861,1,"Subject: market watch undervalued report f
april 2004 top pick of the month
life energy and technology holdings , inc .
( otcbb : leth )
leth receives $ 250 , 000 , 000 in financing to fund the manufacture
of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system
waste - to - energy units in the united states .
first unit to roll - out in new orleans in early second quarter .
we are expecting earth - shattering upcoming news leading a strong
rally in leth for a company that has announced over $ 100 million
in sales orders in the past year , and tops that record - setting
achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $ 8 . 62 per share in
cash for major worldwide expansion .
* * our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick * *
ushg featured at . 75
reached 3 . 65 in 8 days !
traded as high as 7 . 00 since !
the biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand :
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean ,
green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial
wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge
market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity
created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating
5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to
replenish the local or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need
for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding
universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste .
leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a
major push for generating electricity from alternative sources
continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power
failures .
financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales :
the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the
fact that this $ 1 . 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to
$ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process
systems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding
could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor
in that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we
cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with
a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares
outstanding !
leth stock guidance :
current price : 1 . 80
near - term target : 4 . 80
projected high for ' 04 : 12 . 50
leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system :
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 21 )
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical ,
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us
government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will
coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and
continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system
for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department
of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in
the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while
having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge
near - term announcement .
political power fosters rapid global expansion :
leth has captured the profit - making attention of both us and
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity
from alternative sources . this has been accomplished by successfully
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the
political contacts at the highest level from dr . albert reynolds ,
chairman of leth , who is also the former prime minister of ireland .
dr . reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding
leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value
to the size of the market .
uncommon value for a company of this caliber :
we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere ,
the impressive backlog of over $ 100 million in sales orders , and
the company ' s very solid financial position . we view this perfectly
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company ' s
own sales records . as our top stock pick for april , we anticipate
the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite leth shares which carry our highest rating for short - term
trading profits followed by robust long - term capital gains .

i ' ve heard a lot about youlaagan
i must have women - - there is nothing unbends the mind like them . all fair in love and war . much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared . life is not a problem to be solved , but a reality to be experienced .
our thoughts take the wildest flight : even at the moment when they should arrange themselves in thoughtful order . kids use to ask where they came from , now they tell you where to go
i don ' t want to do business with those who don ' t make a profit , because they can ' t give the best service .
the liberals can understand everything but people who don ' t understand them .
a lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants . beware of no man more than of yourself we carry our worst enemies within us .
death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep .
rest not . life is sweeping by go and dare before you die . something mighty and sublime , leave behind to conquer time .
listen ! encourage . say something . do something . be yourself . lovea man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them a fortune .
getting divorced just because you don ' t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do . force without forecast is to little avail .
the problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways : by extinction or duplication .
our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us .

2889,0,"Subject: marketing services / scheduling
daren ,
thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling
the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a
strong case could be made in favor of that idea .
it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,
nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge
base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue .
if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market
intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and
pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services
immensely .
as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and
more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .
i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to
handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to
think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only
person that should be involved in the industrials .
i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you
and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat
that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite
alright .
once again , thanks for listening .

subject : re : misc . questions
questions :
1 . at agua dulce , which pipe can the gp plant go into ? can it go into hpl ?
2 . do you have nom forms for any plant nominations we may need ?
3 . for gemc , is the tejas plant at thompsonville ? do you know how any of
those points tie into hpl ?
4 . do you have avails for mops production ? the gas that is transported to
tivoli - - what contract do you use ?
5 . for kerr mcgee , do you have the entex contacts you speak with ?
6 . is there a waskom nom form ? with whom do you speak over there ?
7 . for the avails sheet you sent , the first row of column titles is blacked
out . can you tell me what the row reads ?
8 . what volumes will come from koch gathering into carthage for next month ?
we show conflicting numbers .
thanks ,
ami
713 / 853 - 9272
here goes . . .
1 . i know tennessee , hpl , and tejas are at the tailgate of the plant , and i
suspect midcon texas is there as well .
2 . i ' ll fax you a copy of the nomination form that steve locke uses for agua
dulce and carthage . . . those are the only ones in texas that we nominate .
3 . the tejas plant as well as all of the other gulf energy receipt points
from
pennzenergy are exclusively tejas / gulf energy points , and it takes transport
charges to move the gas through gulf energy to interconnects , such as
thompsonville . the jennings plant does have a split connect with delhi , but
operationally pennzenergy much prefers to flow into gulf energy ( lower
pressure
= higher volumes ) .
4 . mustang island 759 for january is again 1 , 903 mmbtu / d , which peoples will
pick up at the wellhead . mustang island 785 is 4 , 100 / d , which leaves 2 , 200 / d
available to sell assuming we continue to transport 1 , 895 / d to fgt / tivoli for
peoples . our it agreement on nng is # 78581 to move gas from the wellhead to
onshore .
5 . the tomcat gas has been sold to entex into midcon texas for so long that i
don ' t think maria even talks to them anymore each month . tammi provides them
with the volume when she does the deal each month . but we can certainly
provide an entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in january .
6 . there isn ' t a waskom nomination form . the trader for this gas , mike
landolt , talks to ben britten ( president of new waskom gas gathering and
waskom
gas marketing ) .
7 . you must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with
sabine pass 13 . the 6 columns that appear blacked out read as follows : pvr ,
pvr , avail , dbq , dbq , and remainder .
8 . the koch - gathered volumes behind the carthage plant for 1 / 00 are 12 , 443
mmbtu / d .

subject : re : more questions
1 . at carthage , the deliveries to koch ? what is that 15000 on your
whiteboard for . who is it to ? are the volumes termed up ?
2 . at midcon texas , you usually sell all the supply to its marketing
affiliate , correct ? is so , is that gas termed up or do you sell it month to
month ?
3 . is the gas to entex off tomcat sold as base or swing ? don ' t they change
the volume occasionally ? has anadarko given you any avails for jan ?
round 2 :
1 . the 15 , 000 @ carthage for koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we
will
want to sell into koch . . . and it shows up on the koch whiteboard as a supply
( from carthage ) . during bidweek the traders will decide how much they
actually
want to show going to koch , and how much will be labeled base and swing . mike
landolt has been our sole koch trader and he typically takes some carthage gas
into koch , but i wouldn ' t say a particular volume is termed - up .
2 . other than very rarely shippling the jennings ranch volume over to ngpl ,
we ' ve always sold all of the midcon texas volumes to the affiliate . . .
currently done one month at a time . john hymel has been the trader for these
volumes .
3 . the entex sale @ tomcat has always been gas daily because that is the way
kerr - mcgee prices the supply . . . and entex has taken all the swings . the
january volume is 2 , 312 / d .

dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .
regards ,
mrs . juliana mbuluku

espn to launch sidelines network ' s second reality - based series to
premiere with texas a & m football
espn will launch a 13 - episode , prime - time series this fall entitled
sidelines , the network ' s second reality - based title under the espn
original
entertainment ( eoe ) banner . sidelines will document the season of a
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible ,
less
celebrated people who are involved with the team . the football aggies
of
texas a & m will be the focus of the series ' premiere episodes to begin
october 5 .
"" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting
venture
with espn , "" texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . "" we couldn ' t
be
more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the
opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all
of
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . ""
in a "" docu - drama "" style , the various stories that surround the team will
be
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives
are
directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school .
players
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral
fashion , but will not be the primary focus .
"" this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted
espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people
behind
the scenes , "" head coach r . c . slocum said . "" we look forward to working
with
them . ""
the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who
reflect
every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be
students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some
of
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university .
"" each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal
story , ""
said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original
entertainment . "" sidelines will see each person grow in character as the
season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression
and
fate of the team and its season . ""
sidelines : texas a & m storylines
- - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) .
- - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire
collapse
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year
tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the
emotional
toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an
important
part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a
different form than has been tradition .
- - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in
overtime
to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas ,
oklahoma ,
kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for
great
drama .
- - the school invented the phrase "" 12 th man "" and actually owns the
trademark .
one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and
stand
ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for
every
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team .
- - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at
the
university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s
a & m
team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling
summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys .
- - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a ""
30 , 000
fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition .
eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a
wide - variety
of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and
sports
news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries
or
reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by
appealing
to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is
exploring
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all

breaking news ! !
may 25 , 20 o 5 ! v nomad international inc . ( ndin ) announced today it has
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its
voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which
includes bermuda .
the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to
nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s
market as soon as practicably possible .
the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board
approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .
pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .
would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross
revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive
to the caribbean market .
! ' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the
opportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip
services over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution
relationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the
caribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,
ceo and chairman of nomad international inc .
may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .
about nomad international inc .
nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications
company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,
cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on
targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in
effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,
2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european
presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in
their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more
economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a
means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their
relatives in their country of origin .
conclusion :
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch

today enron and hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $ 666 trillion .
in the deal , enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to hades '
facilities throughout and under north america . john d . rockefeller , former
ceo of energy monopolist standard oil , is now head of hades ' energy
management division . said rockefeller , "" obviously hell has significant
heating demands . while eternal flames are a great idea in concept , they
require vast and reliable fuel resources . enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss , and , as a former monopolist , i just
like the way they do business . ""
a spokesperson for enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations . according to the company , "" the deal fits both
companies exceptionally well . with hades ' ability to attract and retain new
customers , we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come . "" according to several energy industry insiders , hades ' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition .
hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers . the entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years .
enron is one of the world ' s leading energy and communications companies .
the company owns approximately $ 37 billion in energy and communications
assets . enron ranks in the top quarter of fortune ' s "" best 100 companies to
work for if you can keep a job there and don ' t mind working 80 hours a
week , "" and is among the most respected corporations in america , as ranked by
customers with respect - us - or - get - curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts ."
2911,0,"Subject: king ranch
there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that
there is a . 05 cent fee
to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input
a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,
or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .
2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 ."

subject : fw : crm database
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : crm database
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :
1 . account & contact management
2 . activity tracking & planning
3 . potential deal management
4 . outlook synchronization
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :
industrial mkts freight mkts
users 175 45
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000
activities 1 , 200 900
quotes 150
opportunities 361 11
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :
eol
global mkts
ees
transportation
east power orig
insolvent debt
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .
thanks ,

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

of a big push to lower our exposure and the following customer has $ 55 , 000
not including sept production because we ' ve paid manually without having the

sorry it took me so long to get back to you . pg & e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
reduced shrinkage , 19 . 000 mmbtu / d , and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $ 0 . 04 .
pg & e did not have the right to do that , so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock , from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index . at the same time pg & e will create an imbalance , for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days . this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc ( the price in the comstock purchase contract )
and selling it at the gas daily price for 12 / 12 and 12 / 13 . the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out .

ed ,
sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal i have attached below .
apparently we bot from pge industrial on the 12 th and 13 th . pg & e has
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco , and claim that they are
net deals . i do not show a sale in the system at the meter , and i checked
the 215 k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco , perhaps at
another meter , and could not find one .
any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated .

koch never returned my calls . based on the contractual information , we may be
putting ourselves in a risk area by ' assigning ' the deals without proper
documentation . the documentation that was supplied did not refence any ena
agreements , nor any specific meter numbers . if the purchase was indeed a
meter / well sale ; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired
and the effective date . since we are apparently the supplier , the risk is not
as substaintial as if we were the purchaser . however , without documentation
we are basically relying on the relationship btw koch & duke .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

welcome to the "" first "" issue of "" the expatriate zone , "" the official
newsletter of the new "" expatriate zone "" web site . after publishing "" the
temperate zone "" for the past two years , i ' m taking the opportunity to join
forces with bob segel who has been publishing "" the coconut modem "" with karen
coyne since april of 1994 .
last year , after operating in aol exclusively , bob created "" parrotkey . com ""
out on the "" internet "" where it would join it ' s sister site on aol and be
accessible to all parrot heads . at the time bob expanded "" pk , "" we had been
working on my little area of "" club st . somewhere , "" and the new
"" parrotkey . com "" seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club .
while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see "" club st .
somewhere "" and "" parrot key "" go , we could see that this was the perfect chance
to , as emeril says , "" kick it up a notch . ""
jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the
"" expatriate lifestyle "" he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical
travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and
lyrics of mr . james w . buffett .
so it is , that we created our new web site , "" the expatriate zone ""
, along with this newsletter of that same
name . in december , "" the expatriate zone "" opened its doors with its "" island
trading post "" with its holiday shopping service at the "" island trading post . ""
over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were

soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the

"" expatriate of the month ""
james "" sunny jim "" white
when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named "" sunny
jim "" who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance
to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to
happen , it usually does .
on the first leg of my "" road dawg "" tour
( click on "" road dawg "" ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and
their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex
and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was
"" sunny jim . "" i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it
immediately . the cd was his second , called "" life in the laid back lane . ""
little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady "" shady floyd ""
several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real
tour of the us since he moved "" down island "" almost twelve years ago . we got
several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article
about this "" expatriate "" soon on "" the expatriate zone "" web site . be sure to
watch for it .
in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great
musician . when i asked him about his "" expatriate "" status , his reply was ,
"" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country ,
for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they
want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience ,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving ,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms . ""
even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? "" maybe
somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another , "" was the advice he gave .
until we can learn more of "" sunny jim ' s "" world , stop by his web site at
and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his
latest release "" sandbar serenade , "" for goodness sake , pick one up . you can
also read a great interview alex conducted with james at

travel into "" the zone ""
"" some are running from the irs ""
we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops ,
cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if
we feel the need . but get real and throw that "" pager "" away as soon as you can .
we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in "" the zone , "" helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that
are preparing to "" disappear "" to places like costa rica , where the "" the
expatriate zone "" will become an important tool .
how would you like to check out a place to "" disappear "" to and write it off
your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into "" the zone "" to places like
the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic
or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a
coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?
well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .
depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up
to half the trip .

after that , all that ' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember ,

"" jimmydotcom ""
after many delays , "" jimmydotcom "" has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of april . i hit some "" bumps in the road "" on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was
all worth it .
this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on
parrot heads . for more information , visit . we
have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and
samples of the pages on the site .
financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at
the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the "" reservation list . "" you will be
under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial
partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do
it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a
copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing .
let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big
success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .
maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends "" that
just don ' t get it . ""
here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder &
president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with
this club on the "" road dawg "" tour , and shared an advance copy with his club :
"" when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away .
we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs
from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is
your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! ""

club trini update
speaking of expatriates , how about the guys who play the true music of "" the
zone ? "" club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this
april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert
pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third
in the "" margaritaville cafe - late nite "" series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as
my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was
recorded .
you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s
revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve
become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t
heard ct ' s version of "" african friend "" you ' re in for a real treat . along with
that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer , "" cario "" and bob marley ' s "" no woman , no cry . ""
at the new web site , fans can "" now "" order their favorite club trini cds using
their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available .
i think a true "" expatriate musical library "" is incomplete without club trini .
this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer ,
came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the "" ice cream
vendor "" shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok ,
pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves
somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a
t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .

note card series
tro - pics has just released their first note cards
series from their "" jesters and friends "" original oils . friends , places and

expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times
when an email just isn ' t personal enough .
the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and
visit them . included in the "" jesters "" series are our good friends tim glancey

millennium change bubba style
i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this "" new millennium "" thing , one
bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve
show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at
the last minute , i had a change of heart .
and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new
margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded
together for me , making the millennium change over very special .
if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our

flash ! ! ! "" expatriated phans "" spotted south of the border
after making both of "" tropo travel ' s "" previous trips down to cobo san lucas ,
mexico , i had to miss this year ' s trek due to my being with the "" beach house
on the moon "" tour on it ' s florida , new orleans and houston swing .
as the story goes , those bad boys and girls from "" the expatriated phan club ""
showed up again , mainly for the t - shirts that
said , "" too much tequila . . . or not quite enough "" on the back . who are those
people anyway ? whenever i go to their web site , all of them have black bars
covering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
"" down to the banana republics - 2000 "" visit mike
mclain also has some other great trips planned this year , check them out .
speaking of "" tropo travel , "" if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine
shows and want a great deal , visit there site for some great rates . i ' m
joining some of my parrot head friends at the "" key largo , "" though i ' m kind of
afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit
phc . i ' m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i
hate seeing jimmy in vegas , but i ' ve got to keep the streak alive , and seeing
all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer
ends up playing there again this year .
and speaking of those great t - shirts , we have some neat shirts available at
the "" island store . "" they ' re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year ' s trip , except they have "" tropo travel ' s "" seaplane on the back and the
"" no bad days "" logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at

the rates are in the system correctly in unify ( so that we can invoice
correctly ) , but daren ' s group uses a sitara deal ( the transport usage
tickets ) to estimate desk transport in the p & l during the month . right now
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets .
our group has not taken that step , since we have been most concerned with
settling the g / l ( after the month is over ) . by not having the right rates on
the transport usage tickets , the risk is that the p & l will be off during the
month . would we change process and let daren set up the transport usage
ticket and then have us enter the rate ? if so , we would need to change the
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the
correct rate . please let me know what you want to do .

fyi . . . the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much
the marketing desk spent in transport . they can get their expense numbers
either from their estimate ( from cpr ) or from unify , where we put the rates
in .
one potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the
transport capacity tickets , we set up the rates for the transport usage
tickets . i am going through the transport usage tickets for february right
now ( as part of the market meter study ) and i see some rates i don ' t tie back
to lauri ' s matrix . for example , lauri ' s matrix shows 0 . 05 from thompsonville
to hsc , but the transport usage ticket ( updated by daren ' s group ) has 0 . 055 .
this means the economic estimate can be off . let me know what you want to do
with this .

i don ' t think we can even process this request . the east desk was not up and
running on unify in june of 1999 . all of our pathing for june of 1999 was in
autonoms and it ' s not y 2 k compatabile . with the volumes involved being so
small and the accuracy of the data at enerfin in question , why don ' t we let
this volume hit the new oba at enerfin as a ppa ? ? ?

fox sports show host jim rome
1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and
red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in
their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the
feeling the entire school was built to spite ut .
2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a
subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach
agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from
where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m
to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original
creation . like danny devito in "" twins "" .
3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must
devote
their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good .
all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they
won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how
they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell
them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is
the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in
everything a & m does .
4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at
a & m .
there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas '
answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never
learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now ,
forget the fact that a however ,
nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of
the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act
like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect
these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is
only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat
up civilians , move to israel .
5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national
television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the
stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be
against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to
mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and
start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked
down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have
moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game ,
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s
thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board .
some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique
counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give
them a veil .
6 ) "" t . u . "" is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if
folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be
funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it .
please learn .
7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of
sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall
down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit
whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for
the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing
how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for
governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form
asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 "" , weight
185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east
texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade
education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base .
this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid .
8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder ,
they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability .
the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about
marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high
school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then
and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you
do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ?
9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the
only
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now .
10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat
their own feces and should be treated accordingly .
11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that
it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that
should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any
better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
"" dukes of hazard "" episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to
austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open
minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace
and final resting place of all that is cool .
as my friend stephen johnson once said : "" if the world were ever to get an
enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . "" if you go to
school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie .
god bless the great state of texas .

january 2000 - i need deal # 854688 pathed for epgt and for tetc . according to the invoice , we should have
11 , 129 dth on the interconnect .
february 2000 - i need deal # 871184 pathed for hpl and chan . hpl should have 3 , 600 dth and chan should
have 11 , 500 dth on the interconnect .
july 2000 - deal # 871172 has an interconnect issue . according to mops contract # 105124 , they received 8 , 275 dth
on the matagorda 624 , but according to epgt , they delivered 10 , 362 dth to hpl ( ? ) could this possibly

3007,0,"Subject: some after thoughts to our meeting
hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !
mike

we are having some "" after - the - fact "" balancing issues with king ranch . i just
spoke with carol regarding our net position with the plant , she has informed
me that the saxet canales production we are buying at the inlet has been
averaging approximately 3 , 850 dth / day for january , and has been producing at

however , carol was brought online this past week , and i will be receiving
production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries .
we have been scheduling 838 to 1 , 045 dth / day at the meter . we need to gross
up for jan in order to ensure that we capture our volumes correctly and do
not create additional balancing issues with the plant .

23 to beaumont methanol needs to be all priced at the base deal , not on the
swing ticket .

subject : beaumont methanol - meter 1428 - october 2000
ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .
please call with questions .
thanks

commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) ."

fyi - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our
shop from a logistics perspective . i would suggest asking the new ces
employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer

have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to

various issues associated with reconciling and clearing 1999 ua 4 . the scope

whatever hours are needed to get the desired results . yvette will be
locating a room that we can occupy for all of this week and next week . this

be able to either correct or quantify those volumetric adjustments by no
later than mar . 24 , 2000 . this team is effective as of tomorrow , mar . 16 ,
2000 at 9 : 00 a . m .
yvette - please try to locate a room by then and notify the above team members
of the location . in the case that you are not able to find a room right
away , please have everyone go to brenda ' s office in eb 3748 at 9 : 00 a . m .

( u . b . a ) . i have a confidential business suggestion for you . one of our
clients / personalfriend , late mr . kim sean unfortunately lost his life
in the plane crash on january 31 st 2000 including his wife and his only
daughter .
late mr . kim sean is a foreigner and the manager of granite minning
nig , a chemical engineer by profession and he died since the year 2000 .
no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it .
after further investigation it was also discovered that mr . kim sean ' s next
of kin is his daughter who died with him , hence the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proves to me as well that his company does
not know anything about this account and the amount involved is us $ 65 million .
i am contacting you to stand and act as the next of kin to mr . kim
sean . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 40 % of the
total amount , while 60 % will be for me , and any expenses which you and
me may incur during the process of this transaction will also be reconciled
afterwards .
let me have your confidential telephone , fax and mobile numbers . my

hey guys and girls ,
?
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth .
?
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know .
?
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders :
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly ,
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly ,
their expectations will ultimately be met .
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times .
?
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !
?

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled

hi daren ,
i ' m attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report
( revenue volume comparison report ) . howard apprised me , in a meeting last
week , that the reason this meter is appearing in the aforementioned report is
due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops . the
volumes @ this meter is for 4449 ( sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697 . due
to this being a "" check meter "" the volumes will not bridge to pops from mops .
i ' d like to request to revise the nome of 4449 to show "" 0 "" instead . can you
approve this modification ?
thanks

just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

3137,0,"Subject: alternative work schedule status
as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was
scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be
provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .
i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we
know are needed in our work hours .
here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :
schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss
at the next meeting .
each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting
bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow
up with hr on schedules being used at enron
the following is what i heard at the first meeting :
our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that
would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have
the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .
cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "" just do it ""
attitude .
there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk
changes .
late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders
willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address
this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .
there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some
type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .
feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m
looking forward to our next meeting - bob"

stella :
the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting
arrangement on the 012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 contract with the track id 80705 . would
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter 9643 .
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter .
thanks ,
fred"

we do not have deal to enter for this . you need to look at the entire midtex
line for each of the days that are out of balance . if we are short at katy ,
i would think that we would be long at dewville . ( many times , our receipts
from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the
tap . ) this should help you fix the january problem . also , for december , you
may need to ask pg & e where they show the delivery for western . is it at hpl
katy , as our records show , or is it at pge ' s another point on the midtex
line ? in any case , we don ' t have deliveries to make . the only other remedy
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance .

we are still having problem with this meter . from what i understand of our

contracts whole . in the case where we have excess flow the hpl ( r ) contract
takes the swing . so in the case where we are short , shouldn ' t we have a hpl
( d ) contract to take the swing ? please let me know if this will work . i
need to get back with settlement today . thanks

i have a request from the ena settlements group . williams energy is billing

that by the request of the hpl trader , the deals are to be billed to ena . we
would like to have the texas deals billed directly to hpl . if you do not
have a problem with this , can you ask your counterpart at williams to split
the deals between hpl and ena ? it would make the payment process much easier .

subject : unify performance problem on wednesday
as you are aware , the unify system experienced significant performance
problems wednesday from approx 9 : 30 am - 11 : 20 am . the duration of the
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before .
the problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking
that a fresh login might work better . additional logins never improve
performance and generally degrade it , but that is another story . ( there was
actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to "" bounce "" the server
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance .
the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a
particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in
the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have
contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the
behavior is a "" feature "" or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types
of changes at night during scheduled outages .
i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again .
if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a
call .

darren ,
the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can

subject : re : koch midstream services co
since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

i have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?
thanks ,

daren ,
just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues .
for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
a co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen .
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month .
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry . i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached . i hope
you have some insight on this issue .

wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

i have identified the additional hplc wellhead purchases and have made
corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly . jackie is still having
difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase . we feel there are at least
6 meters flowing a total of appox . 7000 a day that are not showing up on a

information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input

with sap now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all
have to make immediately .
first :
everyone will have to make internet explorer their default browser . if
you ' re not sure how to do this give me a call and i will help . the reason
for this is that our new timesheet program will only run through internet
explorer .
second :
sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where i will walk you
through entering your time in this new system . it ' s not time consuming just
different .
third :
next thursday you will be e - mailed an sap log - on id and password . please
don ' t delete or disregard the importance of this e - mail . you will need it to
key your time .
fourth :
all company and rc # ' s are changing . the company part is easy . it will be 4
digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if
it is 012 it will now be 0012 . easy . rc # ' s are now called cost centers and
they are changing completely . please write these down somewhere you will
need them just like you need to know your rc .
rc 1497 = cc 105633
rc 1638 = cc 105634
rc 2664 = cc 105630

the transition shouldn ' t be too painful for you but it promises to be a
little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate .

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

savings plan
due to current business circumstances , on november 28 , 2001 , enron ' s board of directors adopted an amendment to the enron corp . savings plan . the amendment includes the following changes , which became effective on november 29 :
? savings plan contributions that are deducted from your november 30 paycheck will be matched by enron in cash rather than enron stock . the cash match will be placed into the fidelity freedom 2000 fund , the default fund for the plan .
? after november 30 , enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions . as an exception , the company will continue the union matching contributions to the plan .
? the savings plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in enron stock or one or more alternative investment options . effective immediately , diversification within the plan will also be allowed , regardless of your age , from company contribution accounts . this removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account . these accounts include all prior company contributions , qnec , and company match accounts .
to move funds :
on the web , choose "" savings plan - - restricted employer acct transfer / reallocation "" from the drop down menu .
on voice response , choose "" request for fund transfer / reallocation of your restricted employer accounts . ""
this will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts : company matching , union matching , prior matching , and qnec .
to avoid phone delays , we recommend that you access your account through the web at http : / / resources . hewitt . com / enron or through benefits . enron . com ."

as i mentioned to you yesterday , it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert ' s origination fee deducted . do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery ?
also isn ' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo ? is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting ?

do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct ?

donald ,
back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
2000 gas . since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger  , s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
2000 .
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet . is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero ? i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas , but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out . let me know what you think .

having discussed the matter with brian riley , hpl has no intention of
contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price . it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal , relaying this
information and suggesting coastal ' s trader contract brian riley .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

for the texas desk , mike olsen and i will start out handling the scheduling activities . as we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes . we will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs . trading primarily on the waha , katy , and carthage hubs . i will cover katy and carthage . mike will continue to cover waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes . i will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again ( within a month or two ) .
what are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates ?
also , with message of setting up new budgets , can you have brandy send me a copy of the budget we had in place for texas 2002 ?
thanks .

subject : netco items
wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a "" final or startup "" list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements ."

to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits
you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )
concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate
their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network
due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to
you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter
proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .
while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,
enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation
efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it
is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .
many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals
within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those
with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake
hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo
options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between
september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial
hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network
benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other
charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be
pre - certified with uhc .
these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary
care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .
if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .
if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to
uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained
by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .
open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to
consider your elections for 2001 .
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees
through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that
may impact you or your family ."

below is a list of sitara deals that had volume variances or where one side
( purchase / sale ) did not get accrued for the feb 2000 accrual . my goal
here is to bring this to everyone attention and second to see if there is a
solution . i am taking a simplistic approach here in that since
intercompany sitara deals are the same that the nominations on both sides
should match on the month end accruals . if i am wrong on this assumption
or if there is a system limitation i am free to suggestions , ideas or
resolutions . please feel free to give me a call .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

subject : re : rate for tenaska deal
sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

daren ,
when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?
thanks ,

explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue ( ticker : srge ) are being predicted as many
significant news releases indicate strong contractual
revenues with major telecom firms .
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications
giants ( with five million subscriber lines ) over the last 4
years , but is now projecting a banner expansion year with
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands
for their innovative patented products and expansion into
international telecom markets .
surge technologies , inc . ( srge ) is a cutting - edge leader
that designs , develops , manufactures , and markets superior
patented outside plant electrical surge protection
equipment for the telecommunications industry .
the us sales projections for this market are $ 4 billion
annually , with this figure growing rapidly as the
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate
the industry .
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest
quality protection element for complex digital switches .
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage , thus
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time .
major telecoms require this protection throughout their
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming
personnel , damaging expensive equipment , and massive
system failures .

that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this
time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have

the company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project .

reasons to consider mogi :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less
than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets .
4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready
shares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the

made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even
quadruple returns .
breaking news ! !
april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its
sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and
road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig
was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m
well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well
immediately there after .
the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban .
with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and
gas has prepared a detailed project description .
project history
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and
has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil
and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,
predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .
the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major
oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was
abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely
eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the
deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the
west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in
the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more
specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral
rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .
through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres
( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %
of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in
5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .
land discussion
our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and
northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480
acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling
spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160
acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the
province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units
( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased
well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering
pekisko oil we will down space as well .
geological discussion
pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and
associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the
sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the
pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the
mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable
shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and
account for billions of barrels of reserves .
production facilities discussion
this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
constructed .
a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed
drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is
approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,
excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .
this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of
red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get
oil product to the transportation system .
for more detailed project description please see news release dated
( fri , apr 29 ) .
good luck and successfu | trading .
conclusion :
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for

12 / 99 - 4 / 00 production on this meter . i am not seeing this volume in volume
management for these production months . for 5 / 00 and 6 / 00 production , the

stephanie ,
the problem with the january payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly
in sitara . for january production deal 153864 shows hplc purchasing gas
from gmt company inc , not gmt inc . someone needs to either correct the deal
for 1 / 00 or put in a new deal , then i can do an accounting arrangement to
make the necessary correction . it is correct for 2 / 00 on deal 156292 . i
emailed daren on this because i see his name in sitara as the contact , but i
am not sure who actually takes care of it .

although the gas is non - spec , the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
that it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont . go for it .
as a precaution , we are starting a trend and i want to be very cautious .
once we connect a well , we can ' t go backwards . please be specific with gmt
and limit him to this one well . otherwise he could drill more wells and flow
them all through this new meter ."

based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below , please be sure to call me asap .
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal .
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible .
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb . lst .
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 ,
based on the swing parameters that you have been using .

traders ' monthly alert
january pick ( bmxg ) exploded from . 20 to 2 . 07 ,
a gain of over 900 % in 6 days ( 1 / 18 - 1 / 24 ) !
our next pick is an incredible find that will
outperform all others based on their solid
numbers , huge sales backlog , $ 2 billion in
financing , low outstanding shares , and a deal
with chinese government - run companies totaling
$ 10 billion !
urgent buy at any price :
global environmental energy corp .
otcbb - geec
current price - 1 . 90
running to - 6 . 00
geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj
diversified industrials index in the last 2 months . this
is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m , ge ,
and honeywell .
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume
indicating heavy accumulation of shares . this is a sign of
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy ,
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible
to assign a value to the size of the market .
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major
impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and
environmentally safe process converts into clean , green
electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes ,
industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural
gas , and the huge market of used tires .
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is
then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide
need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the
disposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact
the global waste problem while a major push for generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot
topic due to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with
chinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal
mining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300
geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3
billion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting
periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable
municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china
meet its energy needs .
the forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares
should be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still
represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most
explosive gains on wall street .

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil beit

potentia | of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oi | and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas
providing opportunity
for 22 - well re - entry in fieid with strong producing history and large
recoverabie reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and driiled
by major oil companies
in the 1970 s . the field is estabiished with substantia | recoverable
reserves , estimated at over
3 . 9 miilion barreis of oil and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the
two pay zones .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 065
the value of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - miliions , eogi is seliing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably sma | | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but a | | that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y expiosive
effect on the share price .
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or
deciine
slightiy , you will stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wil | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well estabiished and are going into massive
production .
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this

kowloon , hong kong .
reply destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
i am mr . srichai pope , credit officer of win hang bank ltd . i have an urgent and
very
confidential business proposition for you .
on august 6 , 1999 , a british consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals
corporation , mr . philip brian a british citizen made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit
for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty - eight million
dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent aroutine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply .
after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers , the hong kong solid minerals corporation that mr . philip brian died from
a boat mishap . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a
will , and all attempts totrace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made
further investigation and discovered that mr . philip brian did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my
bank . this sum of us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever
come forward to claim it . according to laws of hong kong , at the expiration of 5
( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the hong kong
government if nobody applies to claim the fund .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the
next of kin to mr . philip brian so that the fruits of this old man ' s labor will not get
into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple , i will like you to
provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of
kin .
the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65 % for me
and 30 % for you and 5 % for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction .
there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the
attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction .
if you are interested , please reply immediately to my e - mail
box . destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction . please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication . you should
observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply .
sincerely

subject : re : deal 819348
i ' m assuming that since this deal is on the new texas desk , and that no new deals have been negotiated under ces counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ena - im texas ( which i believe no longer exists as part of the post - hpl / aep processes ) to ena - im lonestar . the deals have been split several times anderson , bridgette ; campos , anthony ; gonzales , sharon

subject : deal 819348
i was researching deal 819348 ( ces - midcon texas gas services corp ) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 ( in fact , the gtc firm had three deals attached ) . since one of the deals ended 03 / 31 / 01 , we won ' t bother correcting that one , but this deal needs to be moved . i set up contract 96061912 and attached it today . this deal still needs to be reviewed by cyndie before the cp is inactivated .
elizabeth , could you please revalidate this deal ?
my team , could you please add this one to your daily deal count report ?
ellen , could you please reconfirm if necessary ?
thanks , all . please let me know if you have any questions .

mary :
is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance
between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume ,
and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have
support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350
mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of "" nothing "" being
confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000
this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells .
from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the
volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas
measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is
calculating the volumes incorrectly .
this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the
system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive
monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas
schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working
on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss .
tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting
arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and
possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
originally set up in pops .
i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it
or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you .

subject : big cowboy for august
daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics .
thank you ,

3493,0,"Subject: fw : the odds are against them
there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

shawna ,
attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

lal ,
we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

subject : resume for summer internship
april 20 , 2000
dear mr . mcconnell :
thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with enron . i understand that you have spoken to my father , scott
wells at texaco , and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one .
i ' d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer .
i interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry . i worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler , and after only a month i was controlling the northeast cng
pipeline . this helped because i really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points .
other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning . throughout the day i would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor . it was all a great learning experience for me and i hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for enron .
i would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
resource personnel so that i might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility . i will be available to have a start date of
may 15 th and be available for employment until school resumes in late august .
thank you for your time , and i look forward to hearing from someone in your
company at his / her earliest convenience . please feel free to call me at
940 - 323 - 0891 , or email me at rollins 50 @ aol . com .
sincerely -
sean wells

this is a statement that was read over the pa system at the football game
at roane county high school , kingston , tennessee by school principal jody
mcloud , on september 1 , 2000 . i thought it was worth sharing with the
world , and hope you will forward it to all your friends . it clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction .
"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games
to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country .
due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of federal case law .
as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if
someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no
problem .
i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth ,
and call it ecology .
i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment .
however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is
violated .
this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical .
apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and
his commandments .
nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression .
for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and
refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor ,
praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event ,
please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law -
yet . ""
and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands
with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed
in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed
in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme
court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one
nation under god .
somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we
are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion .
praise god that his remnant remains !
let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001
jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my
father . ""
- - - - - - - - -
if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it .
yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me
functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without
him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that
strengthens me . phil 4 : 13

to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this

from matt ' s response it sounds like you might want to specify exception personnel for 8 - 12 , 12 thru 4 : 00 , and 4 thru 6 normal business hours and not end of the month , holidays or long weekends .

yes , you are correct . when we watchdog , we ' ll most likely do vm and settlements and not pm . but , in the afternoon , if they need payments out the door , pm will get it . it goes both ways . so , if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what , that would help .
you are correct , 8 - 12 is logistics critical , and after that it ' s anyones guess .

based on victor ' s response , i think there is some confusion . there are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day . perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog . i interpreted it to mean the 8 - 12 am period but victor was thinking the afternoon . depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out .

going forward , as a precautionary measure , we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises . we will use our watchdog application in order to initiate this process . we will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this . our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most .
the old list we had from sybase no longer exists . i need your help in putting together a new list . please provide the list of people who are absolutely critical users that have to be on the system . obviously , the situation isn ' t remedied if everyone is an exception user : )
please provide user name and application they need ( i . e . volume management , settlements , path manager ) .
the sooner i get this , the sooner we can get this implemented .

dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .
before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .
the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .
it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .
i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .
i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .
you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .
thank for your anticipated co - operations .

george -
in this afternoon ' s meeting with producer services , jill mentioned that the
referenced well had been reperfed ( meaning they shot more holes in the well
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well ) and was now producing
approximately 800 / day . per jill , the mdq on this well is 3000 / day . you may
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month .
mary - could you get heidi or lisa to check the transport rate we currently
show on this ? it ' s being purchased for sc - . 17 and is flowing through king
ranch .

3569,0,"Subject: cleburne issues
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david
gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a
pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in
1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with
another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas ,
they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at
that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have
been connected with the lord  @ s work in croatia for all these years . before
leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they
raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado
springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and
david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now
i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a
biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday .
dragica and i believe god listens and hears ? prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

though she ' s dead and has just been located , after 5 years , this lady

get this :
cbs will be forced to discontinue "" touched by an angel "" for using the word
god in every program . madeline murray o ' hare , an atheist , successfully
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few
years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the
same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,
dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .
they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is
successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a
christian can help !
we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their
effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned
about our country . as christians we must unite on this .
please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation .
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .
together we
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the lord .
please press "" forward "" , clean up the message , and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this .
now , please sign your name at the bottom ( you can only add your name after
you have pressed the "" forward "" ) .
don ' t delete any other names , just go to the next number and type your name .
please do not sign jointly , such as mr . & mrs . each person should sign
his / her own name .
please e - mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this , and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion .

bpet ( bnp petroleum corp ) is in position to take advantage of the
current oil crisis . stock in this company is expected to dramatically

news :
london ( reuters ) - - march 31 , 20 o 5 - - oil markets have entered a
` ` super - spike ' ' period that could see 1970 ' s - style price surges as high as
$ 105 a barrel , investment bank goldman sachs said in a research report .
goldman ' s global investment research note also raised the bank ' s 20 o 5
and 2006 new york mercantile exchange crude price forecasts to $ 5 o and
$ 55 respectively , from $ 41 and $ 4 o .
these forecasts sit at the top of a table of predictions from 25
analysts , consultants and government bodies surveyed by reuters .
` ` we believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we
have referred to as a ` ` super spike ' ' period - - a multi - year trading
band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy consumption
and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower energy
prices return , ' ' goldman ' s analysts wrote .
c o m p a n y o v e r v i e w
bnp petroleum corporation , inc . is an irving based oil and gas
exploration and development ( ed ) company . bnp petroleum corporation , inc . was
formed for the purpose of development and operation of oil and gas
properties with proven reserves . the company ' s strategy is to focus in
domestic areas where major oil and gas producing companies have reduced
their exploration efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of the
larger reserves . considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to be
exploited by well - managed independent oil companies capable of
extracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved prospects .
bnp petroleum ' s initial development strategy has been to acquire such
proven fields and increase production through the application of
advanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in the same
fields .
bnp petroleum corporation ' s primary operational strategy includes the
operation of its own projects , giving it substantial control over
drilling and production costs . the company has associated with highly
experienced exploration and development engineering and geology personnel that
strive to add production at lower costs through development drilling ,
workovers , behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery operations .
the company ' s long - term strategy is to build an oil and gas production
company through a strategic combination of selected property
acquisitions and an exploration program . additionally , the company will continue
to rework existing wells in an attempt to increase production and
reserves .
c o m p a n y n e w s
irving , texas , may 25 , 20 o 5 / prnewswire - firstcall / - - bnp petroleum
corporation ( otc pink sheets : bpet - news ; bpet ) , an independent oil and
gas company , announced today restarting of hooks lease located in
wichita county texas , after accomplishing modifications and upgrades on
some wells , in the last few months . the shallow wells previously had been
producing oil and water at low rates due to low bottom pressure , which
is normal for the area . steadily increasing rates of production for
hooks lease are expected .
bnp director , rafael pinedo said today , bnp petroleum will begin
immediately to restart other leases in our portfolio of properties and
complete all necessary work to assure that bnp ' s properties are in full
compliance with the regulations of the texas railroad commission and re -
establish oil production on bnp ' s leases over the coming months .

daren ,
sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider

introducing
doctor - formulated
hgh
human growth hormone - also called hgh
is referred to in medical science as the master hormone . it is very plentiful
when we are young , but near the age of twenty - one our bodies begin to produce
less of it . by the time we are forty nearly everyone is deficient in hgh ,
and at eighty our production has normally diminished at least 90 - 95 % .
advantages of hgh :
- increased muscle strength
- loss in body fat
- increased bone density
- lower blood pressure
- quickens wound healing
- reduces cellulite
- improved vision
- wrinkle disappearance
- increased skin thickness texture
- increased energy levels
- improved sleep and emotional stability
- improved memory and mental alertness
- increased sexual potency
- resistance to common illness
- strengthened heart muscle
- controlled cholesterol
- controlled mood swings
- new hair growth and color restore

application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market
will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not
cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a
total basis .

subject : re : fuel
we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

brenda ,
as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get
the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price . can the
downstream systems , scheduling etc handle this ?"
